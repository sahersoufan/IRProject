532,533.0,digital synthesis of correlated stationary noise peabody  adorno  in this note we propose a method of generating stationary noise with a prescribed auto covariance function by digital methods the need for such a technique often arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems where inputs corrupted with correlated noise of a known form are required the technique is quite simple and produces strict sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with r t the prescribed auto covariance function acf over an interval t 0 t 0 the method consists of approximating the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and appropriate amplitudes in order to simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the noise generated the technique is first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis in practice discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third section is used,1962-07-01

669,670.0,some legal implications of the use of computers in the banking business freed  the introduction of computers in to the banking business has a wide variety of legal implications that merit careful attention at this very early stage the industry is highly regulated by government and hence is subject to many statutes and regulations it also is affected by important common law rules established by courts the legal ramifications involve not only the mechanization itself but also the very significant economically attractive phenomenon of off premises processing it is essential to identify and provide for many legal aspects right now before systems and practices crystallize in order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical complications and expense the legal aspects of computerization in the banking business are especially diverse in some states there might be the basic question whether banks are authorized by law to invest in the new facilities either directly or through cooperatives more challenging are questions relating to off premises processors particularly with respect to the obligation not to disclose information concerning a bank s customers the adequacy of fidelity bond coverage the extent of liability for improper refusal to pay a check and susceptibility to regulation by government agencies also pertinent is the propriety of data processing by banks for nonbank entities and particularly of the rendering of that service without charge for bank depositors,1963-12-01

1134,1135.0,a general business oriented language based on decision expressions lombardi  the structure of a digital compute programming language which covers a wide class of business and file processing applications is presented such a structure based on identifying and incorporating into a compiler the aspects common to all processes of such class permits writing extremely compact programs even for comparatively complex applications in terms of tables of control expressions which express only information characteristic of the particular application furthermore local changes of a process e g changes affecting only one of the output files involved can be effected by local modifications in the program e g modification of only one entry of the tables this structure also allows for inexpensive preparation of loading speed compilers which translate the source programs into efficient machine codes the approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical language design philosophies it stresses the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented in the languages as opposed to emphasizing formal i e contents independent syntactical definitions it relies exclusively on nonprocedural representation of process as sets tables of relations between data and results there are no control statements such as go to etc instead of using procedure descriptions which are one to one translations of flowcharts here an invariant pattern of procedure is identified as characteristic of the class of all batch file processes this new philosophy has the potential to overcome well known deficiencies of other business oriented languages and fully meets the requirements set by codasyl for such languages including machine independence,1964-02-01

1726,1727.0,one way of estimating frequencies of jumps in a program kral  for the segmentation of a program it is useful to have a reasonable estimation of the values of s ij where s ij is the mean value of the number of jumps from the i th instruction on to the j th instruction in the run time in the cases where the s ij are estimated directly the structure of the whole program must be generally taken into account therefore it is very difficult for the programmer and or the translator to obtain a good estimation of the s ij it is easier to estimate not s ij but the quantities p ij s ij c i sum s ij j 1 n where c i is an arbitrary positive constant for each i although the p ij are for each i proportional to s ij the estimation of p ij is easier because we must estimate only the probabilities of events where instruction i is executed after instruction i i this estimation can often be done without considering the structure of the whole program in the first part of the paper using the theory of the markov chains an algorithm for the computation of the s ij from the p ij is found and some ways of obtaining estimates of the p ij are given in the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived avoiding the necessity of computation involving large matrices,1968-07-01

1843,1844.0,a modular computer sharing system baskin  horowitz  tennison  rittenhouse  an alternative approach to the design and organization of a general purpose interactive multiterminal computing system is presented the system organization described is a conceptually simple arrangement of a bank of interchangeable computers each of which is a memory processor pair that are assigned to process terminal jobs as they arrive one of the computers serves as the master or control computer and supervises the collection and distribution of messages from and to the remote terminals in the simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected terminal a crosspoint switching network allows any such disk drive to be connected to any computer thus while each active terminal user occupies a dedicated disk drive he may share the computer with many other terminal users in a simple manner the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both the size and power of the machines used and the computation requirements of the particular mix of users this system organization is inherently a simpler and therefore more reliable approach to time sharing computers and has the potential of a highly available system at relatively low cost economic configurations are possible for a range of systems sizes that span at least one order of magnitude finally problem programs developed by remote terminal users can be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used,1969-10-01

1878,1879.0,a note on storage fragmentation and program segmentation randell  the main purpose of this paper is the presentation of some of the results of a series of simulation experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation two different types of storage fragmentation are distinguished 1 external fragmentation namely the loss in storage utilization caused by the inability to make use of all available storage after it has been fragmented into a large number of separate blocks and 2 internal fragmentation the loss of utilization caused by rounding up a request for storage rather than allocating only the exact number of words required the most striking result is the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for storage to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks coexisting in storage causes more loss of storage by increased internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external fragmentation described also are a method of segment allocation and an accompanying technique for segment addressing which take advantage of the above result evidence is presented of possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques,1969-07-01

2032,2033.0,space time trade offs in hash coding with allowable errors bloom  in this paper trade offs among certain computational factors a given set of messages two new hash coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash coding method the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area space the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set reject time and an allowable error frequency the new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash coded information from that associated with conventional methods the reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications in particular applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods in such applications it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and when necessary by using some secondary and perhaps time consuming test to catch the small fraction of errors associated with new methods an example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time,1970-07-01

2357,2358.0,the multics virtual memory concepts and design bensoussan  clingen  daley  as experience with use of on line operating systems has grown the need to share information among system users has become increasingly apparent many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing usually sharing is accomplished by allowing several users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage through the use of segmentation however multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information independent of its physical storage location information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege here the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large segmented main memory since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited it is then shown how the multics software achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the honeywell 645 segmentation and paging hardware,1972-05-01
2358,2359.0,an improved index sequential access method using hashed overflow mullin  the index sequential access method isam is one of the most important file management systems used with moveable head disk devices this study investigates the use of an unconventional method of treating overflow records the method is to use hashing techniques to allocate space for such records if certain conditions are satisfied this is superior to the conventional isam method of chaining the overflow records via linked list techniques these conditions are long overflow chains with significant overflow lack of tight disk space constraints record keys which are small compared to the total record size and significant use of the file in the index as opposed to the sequential mode using hashed overflow the time to locate a record is dependent not on the total volume of overflow records as in conventional isam but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records,1972-05-01
