0,1.0,18 editions of the dewey decimal classifications comaromi  the present study is a history of the dewey decimal classification the first edition of the ddc was published in 1876 the eighteenth edition in 1971 and future editions will continue to appear as needed in spite of the ddc s long and healthy life however its full story has never been told there have been biographies of dewey that briefly describe his system but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad,
1,2.0,use made of technical libraries slater  this report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the united kingdom library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents it takes no account of documents used outside the library still less of information transferred orally from person to person the library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred taking technical information transfer as a whole there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one there are users of technical information particularly in technology rather than science who visit libraries rarely if at all relying on desk collections of handbooks current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations even regular library users also receive information in other ways,
2,3.0,two kinds of power an essay on bibliographic control wilson  the relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story for writings contain along with much else a great deal of mankind s stock of knowledge and information bibliographical control is a form of power and if knowledge itself is a form of power as the familiar slogan claims bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form as writings are not simply and not in any simple way storehouses of knowledge we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings,
3,4.0,systems analysis of a university library final report and research project buckland  the establishment of nine new universities in the 1960 s provoked a highly stimulating re examination of the nature purpose and management of academic libraries long established attitudes and methods were questioned but although changes were made the basic difficulty remained a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university the report of the ugc committee on libraries the parry repot 267 which in general endorsed these changes also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision,
4,5.0,a library management game a report on a research project brophy  although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years its origins have been traced to simple war games used in military training when the real thing was either unavailable or too dangerous in more recent times these games have become more and more sophisticated and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved since 1956 when the first well developed management game was introduced the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women one of the main causes of this game explosion has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques such as simulation and mathematical modelling which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology,
5,6.0,abstracting concepts and methods borko  graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how to do it course it should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts the historical development of abstracting publications the abstract publishing industry especially in the united states and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product these topics we call concepts the text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts and for editing and preparing abstracting publications these detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix there is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications research on automation has been treated extensively in this work for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer prepared abstracts and extracts students librarians and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text select key sentences and prepare extracts and abstracts the benefits of this research are discussed abstracting is a key segment of the information industry opportunities are available for both full time professionals and part time or volunteer workers many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information one chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors,
6,7.0,academic library buildings a guide to architectural issues and solutions ellsworth  this book attempts to present representative examples of successful architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and architects face in planning new college and university library buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures it does not attempt to make case study evaluations as was done by ellsworth mason for brown and yale nor does it present examples of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes and in these cases the libraries will not be identified,
7,8.0,the academic library essays in honor of guy r lyle farber  as important for staff members individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt his love of literature his respect for scholarship his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways but most notably in his admonition that though we were primarily a research library we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry fiction and belles letters it was primarily up to the library staff he felt to be responsible for these as well as for general books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook and in building this portion of the collection there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves this counsel is from the president the professor and the college library but the importance of its thrust the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing was continually impressed upon us,
8,9.0,access to libraries in college hyman  this study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts the basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access principal data gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire findings of the documentary analysis included the following research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research the need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed open shelf libraries organized through shelf classification and relative location were meant to arouse the intellectual social and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self realization definitions of browsing varied greatly self indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works beneficial self education for the general reader valuable guidance for the scholar in his research,
9,10.0,access to periodical resources palmour  the purpose of this study was to develop evaluate and recommend a national plan for improving access to periodical resources about 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies a major consideration in the long range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring storing and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials this study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature based on the needs of the library community design features were developed and included the following service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library initially the service should be confined primarily to rapid dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles the collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine all worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language,
10,11.0,the acquisition of library materials ford  the scope of acquisitions work outlined in the introduction acknowledges the importance of selection policy serials recording and other topics kindred to acquisitions these topics are discussed in this book only as they relate to obtaining library materials they are examined thoroughly in books and papers that are cited in the references and the bibliographic note centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in this book these chapters are introductions to the concepts and problems of centralization and automation not manuals of practice for treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is referred to the references cited for automation these references are only a modest selection from an enormous literature,
11,12.0,acquisition from the 3rd world clarke  the ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche liber was set up in 1971 as an international non governmental organization with the aim of establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of western europe particularly national and university libraries and in particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of the services these libraries provide at the second meeting of its general assembly held in luxembourg in 1972 liber decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the third world and i was charged with the intellectual organization of this seminar the purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition the availability of materials in european libraries both for reference and for lending and the feasibility of setting up a european centre for the collection of such material to be available for loan the provision of bibliographic information preferable in machine readable form was to be a basic consideration whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas the council of europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the university of sussex from 17 to 19 september 1973,

13,14.0,the administration of the college library lyle  if this book has a central thesis it rests upon the simple but frequently neglected principle that college library service goes beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and storage the college library exists not merely to house and circulate library materials but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction and to encourage students to read more and better books administration is essentially a service activity a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized the present work retains most of the material of the first edition but includes substantial revision in each chapter the book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended,
14,15.0,information flow in research and development laboratories allen  cohen  technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories were examined using modified sociometric techniques the structure of technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the interaction of both social relations and work structure the sociometric stars in the technical communication network who provide other members of the organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside the organization or read the literature more than other members of the laboratory,
15,16.0,adopting the library of congress classification system matthis  this manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change efficiently to the library of congress classification system detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning making the preparations selecting the tools and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project beyond this considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the lc classification series biography bibliography law pz3 and pz4 in addition the literature tables viiia and ixa two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples since the mechanics production and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of xerox copying machines in library operations finally an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50 year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification the numbers enclosed in parentheses throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case,
16,17.0,adventures in librarianship voigt  there has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice advances in librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need it will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature research in progress and developments in libraries of all types mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series as the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected advances in librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation assessing where we are where we are going and how fast we can hope to get there the machine and cataloging reviews the current status of the machine produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of marc where business methods have greater applicability progress is easier as reported in mechanization of acquisition processes even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future not the past one of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in filing systems for computer manipulation this detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions for many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts as automated procedures are proposed standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential the article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years the school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries as reflected in its new name the instructional media center here technical change together with new teaching methods has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries the articles on the application of these concepts which come from research in administration are provocative and may appear controversial to some the article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world,1970-01-01 00:00:00
17,18.0,selective dissemination of information mauerhoff  the present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971 additionally it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history of the mechanized selective dissemination of information sdi as reflected in the literature from the initial description by luhn 1958 1961b c to the post 1970 period when the sdi boom began losing ground to the more popular on line interactive systems the review therefore questions and interprets the concept of sdi its implementation and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies government agencies universities societies and libraries during the last fourteen years,1974-01-01 00:00:00
18,19.0,adventures in theory of languages herdan  in trying to give an account of the statistical properties of language one is faced with the problem of having to find the common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms of language statistics embodied in scattered papers written by linguists philosophers mathematicians engineers each using his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole quantitative linguistics the book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics to put the difference between two types of statistics briefly the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied e g in economics and demography the former has its own methods and characterising parameters particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure the idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own which was adumbrated in the author s language as choice and chance 1956 has now taken definite shape of this development i shall try to give a brief account in my book language as choice and chance the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample,
19,20.0,the age of jewett charles coffin jewett and american librarianship 1841 1868 harris  most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship from the founding of the american library association in 1876 and the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and controversial figures as melvil dewey and charles ammi cutter but in doing so they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of american librarianship this period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in america after 1876 to ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post 1876 era and in this time of reappraisal it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the american library association,
20,21.0,on aggression lorenz  in this book lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates he points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage this be it noted is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co operation without fighting is necessary for survival whereas in the non social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate in a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species where evolution is primarily cultural and not guided by darwinian selection in the strict sense the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior many of them analogous if not homologous to those found in animals in any event on aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject,
21,22.0,education and manpower for librarians asheim  this paper is not an official policy statement of the american library association nor of the office for library education it is simply an exploration an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of association policy that the profession will support and make effective a basic assumption on which the statement rests is this that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession it follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries they should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call professional,
22,23.0,pilot inventory of library holdings braden  this project was undertaken because of the high degree of uncertainty among the library staff regarding the extent of the problem of missing books the findings of this study gave the ohio state university libraries concrete evidence as to how many books are missing and indicated the areas in which book losses are the greatest these figures also provide information which can be conveyed to the faculty or administration when they voice complaints about the unavailability of library books the areas where losses are high also tend to indicate the areas of most frequent use,
23,24.0,libraries and technological forces affecting them cuadra  1 what do we mean by technology and what kind of technological forces are we concerned with 2 why is it important to be concerned with technology in thinking about the future of libraries 3 what kinds of technology are particularly important for libraries 4 how can this technology be applied today 5 what can we foresee for the future as we move toward the year 2000 6 what if anything should we do tomorrow to try to get from here to here,
24,25.0,algebraic systems maltsev  as far back as the 1920 s algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations however up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures these were primarily groups rings and lattices the first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to g birkhoff 1935 during these same years a tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations such sets are now called models in contrast to algebra model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic the possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936 during the next twenty five years it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems and it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations algebraic systems the formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so called applied predicate calculus thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra,
25,26.0,indexing and abstracting by association doyle  this article discusses the possibility of exploiting the statistics of word co occurrence in text for purposes of document retrieval co occurrence is defined and related to the mental processes of authors and readers several means of quantitative measurement of word co occurrence are then scrutinized it is shown that the most strongly co occurring word pairs which are therefore associated in a statistical sense can be represented in the form of an association map the last half of the article presents two modes of use of association maps in literature searching,
26,27.0,cost analysis and simulation procedures for the evaluation of large information systems bourne  ford  a computer program has been written and used which simulates the several year operation of an information system and computes estimates of the expected operating costs as well as the amount of equipment and personnel required during that time period the program has been used for the analysis of several large systems and has proven itself to be a useful research tool for the study of systems with so many components and interrelated operations that an equivalent manual analysis would be extremely cumbersome and time consuming and perhaps even impractical this paper describes this program and shows as an example some of the results of a simulation of two of several suggested designs for a specific information system,
27,28.0,a note on the pseudo mathematics of relevance taube  recently a number of articles books and reports dealing with information systems i e document retrieval systems have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means and some doubt that it is quantifiable there is nevertheless a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system thus we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users and equations curves and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems this phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability one cannot of course legislate the meaning of a term it all depends as alice pointed out on who is master the user or the term on the other hand the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity,
28,29.0,some questions concerning information need o connor  the expression satisfying a requester s information need is often used but its meaning is obscure the literature on information need in relation to retrieval suggests three different though not inconsistent possible interpretations however each of these interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear the various obscurities involved are indicated by critical questions which those who write of information need are invited to answer,
29,30.0,vocabulary building and control techniques wall  the rationale is given for creation and maintainance by an information center of a controlled indexing and retrieval vocabulary basic vocabulary principles are 1 use of natural language 2 development of hospitality to new concepts 3 provision of adequate cross referencing and 4 formatting for easy use terminalogical conventions necessary for development and control of a useful vocabulary are summarized and the techniques for applying these conventions to construct a thesaurus are described computerized editing techniques and updating techniques are briefly set forth,
30,31.0,attendance and use of the science library at m i t bush  galliher  morse  this is an interim report on continuing studies of library operations at massachusetts institute of technology being made by members of the institute s operations research project in cooperation with the librarians and library staff in this report which is based on actual observations of on the premise use made of the science library various statistics measuring the kind degree and intensity of use are tabulated in addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library a unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons such models characteristic of an operations research approach give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning,
31,32.0,information gathering patterns and creativity a study of research chemists in an industrial research laboratory maizell  a comparison of creative and noncreative research chemists with respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical literature the creative chemists differ from the noncreative in that the former read more technical literature on the job are less reluctant to use literature of greater reading difficulty are less influenced in their independence of thought read more extensively and consult more frequently the older material are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests the findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and information services in refining future inquiries into the ways in which scientists use recorded information and in improving tests for the identification of creative ability among chemists,
32,33.0,the half life of some scientific and technical literatures kebler  a consideration of the analogy between the half life of radioactive substances and the rate of obsolescence of scientific literature the validity of this analogy suggest the possibility of more accurate prognostications concerning the period of time during which scientific literature may by used and hence might help to guide the planning of library collections and technical information services,
33,34.0,keyword in context index for technical literature kwic index luhn  a distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for currency indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable for disseminating new information these can be entirely machine generated and hence kept up to date with the current literature a compatible coding scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed in it elements are automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible to normal methods of ordering,
34,35.0,comparisons of four types of lexical indicators of content rath  resnick  savage  an experiment was conducted to determine which of four types of lexical indicators of content could be utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100 questions the results indicate that there were no major differences between the groups using complete text and abstracts to select relevant documents but the group utilizing the complete text obtained a significantly higher score on the examination,
35,36.0,recorded use of books in the yale medical library kilgour  explores the amount of use of books by categories of borrowers in the yale medical library with a view to discovering the proportion of the catalogue which should be put in machinable form,
36,37.0,the world s technical journal literature an estimate of volume origin language field indexing and abstracting bourne  a quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the world s scientific and technical journal literature problem using a number of basic sources of statistical information a composite picture is established to show such things as the total volume linguistic and national origins breakdown by subject field and degree of coverage by the abstracting and indexing services,
37,38.0,machinelike indexing by people montgomery  swanson  a study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography of article titles the index medicus revealed that a large proportion of the title entries contained words identical to or synonymous with words of the corresponding subject heading it is inferred that a major part of the bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine procedure operating on titles alone provided the machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary,
38,39.0,bibliographic coupling between scientific papers kessler  this report describes the results of automatic processing of a large number of scientific papers according to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling the population of papers under study was ordered into groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation an examination of the papers that constitute the groups shows a high degree of logical correlation,
39,40.0,worldwide census of scientific and technical serials desmond  results of the census of the world s scientific and technical serial literature within the limits defined and based on an examination of published source material from countries throughout the world reflect a total title population much lower than estimated before distribution of this population by country showing better than 50 of the total divided among six major countries is included and discussed together with a broad subject distribution of serials for certain countries,
40,41.0,new factors in the evaluation of scientific literature through citation indexing sher  more than one million citations from the scientific literature have been processed by the citation index project at the institute for scientific information the project sponsored by nsf and nih will be described briefly and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be discussed summaries of statistical data compiled by computer methods such as the following will be given 1 frequency of citation of one journal by another 2 frequency of current citations to the past literature 3 frequency of self citation by journals and authors 4 number of source citations per cited paper 5 number of references per source paper 6 number of papers published per journal,
41,42.0,the notion of relevance hillman  analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of conceptual relatedness in order to consider the later problem the question of concept formation is first discussed which in turn requires a definition of concept an extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually similar documents users similarity judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness it is found however that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed since this method is based on human relevance judgments it seems a natural one to adopt so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences an alternative approach is therefore proposed whose elaboration will form part ii of this article,
42,43.0,the consistency of human judgments of relevance savage  a comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance of documents to their general interests from bases of citations abstracts keywords and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions the results showed that 1 humans are able to make such judgments consistently and 2 the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base from which it is made apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the basis of abstracts remains unexplained this experiment as well as others concerned with human evaluations of text material leave unexplored the basic problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured,
43,44.0,the distribution of term usage in manipulative indexes wall  a semi empirical correlation based on data from nine indexes permits the prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which will be used to index any given number of documents this is a function of the total number of index entries in the system a log normal relationship similar to zipf s law exists between total index entries and distribution of term usage based upon the correlation optimum vocabulary size and growth rate can inferred as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a storage medium the results agree well with published data and appear to be particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication operations,
44,45.0,measuring the reliability of subject classification by men and machines borko  procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are described three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological reports into one of eleven categories these abstracts were also mechanically classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the highest score the three manual classifications were compared with each other and with the mechanical classifications and a series of contingency coefficients was computed the average reliability of manual classification procedures was equal to 870 the correlation between automatic and manual classification was 766,
45,46.0,a quantitative measure of user circulation requirements and its possible effect on stack thinning and multiple copy determination trueswell  the strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the librarian for thinning a library s stack according to the criterion of user needs the method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user circulation requirements the resulting stack collection would by design satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of minimum size preliminary but not yet fully validated research indicates that the number of volumes in a library s holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements it may also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order that user disappointment can be minimized the effective result of this approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the library s holdings at a reasonable level and in addition a reduction in the disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of use by another,
46,47.0,improvement of the selectivity of citation indexes to science literature through inclusion of citation relationship indicators lipetz  citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can afford the time to look up by providing some additional information beyond the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference a citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search requirement means of providing this selectivity are discussed particular attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication is operationally related to the cited one this method is an integral feature of the shepard s legal citations a scheme of citation relationships of potential value to users of science literature is presented these relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature the suggested categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the scientific process in general as well as indicators of its relationship to the cited reference in particular assignment of the categories to a citation requires the exercise of judgment as in subject indexing but does not involve the use of subject terminology an illustration is provided of the application from a citation index to physics literature,
47,48.0,the norms of citation behavior prolegomena to the footnote kaplan  the publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly footnote while we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper little is known about the norms operating in actual practice even less is known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of recognition upon the works of others this paper reviews the state of our knowledge raises questions and proposes suggestions and hypotheses for studying the relationships between footnoting practices among scientists and the social system of science,
48,49.0,adaptive information dissemination fitzwater  computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are impractical and in some cases impossible for a human this paper describes the ames laboratory selective dissemination of information system with emphasis on the effectiveness of user feedback the system will accept any document abstract keyword etc in a kwic or science citation index source format user profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially assigned significance value these values are used in making the decision to notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document according to responses the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user s interests the system is economical compared to other existing sdi systems and human intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries,
49,50.0,comparison of the results of bibliographic coupling and analytic subject indexing kessler  a detailed comparison of how 334 papers in volume 112 of physical review form related groups according to two criteria of relatedness the criteria are 1 the analytic subject index as used by the editors of the physical review and 2 the method of bibliographic coupling the similarities and differences between the groups thus formed are illustrated and discussed,
50,51.0,an experiment in automatic indexing damerau  this report describes a method of indexing documents which is based on the assumptions 1 that a subset of the words in a document can be an effective index to that document and 2 that this subject can be approximated by selecting those words from the document whose frequencies are statistically unexpectedly high the results of the experiment are encouraging although not definitive because any index set chosen must be tested by using it for retrieval from a large collection,
51,52.0,comparative indexing terms supplied by biomedical authors and by document titles orr  the original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the much argued question of whether author indexing is good author indexing of 285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author supplied terms author set for each paper with a criterion set of terms that was established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same document terms in the document title title set were scored similarly the average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73 of the maximal possible score as compared with 44 for the average title set when judged by the method and criterion employed here author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles the findings suggest that indicia supplied by an author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues the general method developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of wide applicability,
52,53.0,the kwic index concept a retrospective view fischer  this paper defines and describes the kwic keyword in context index concept providing a history of the concept and of its literature it discusses variations of the index such as the bell telephone index kwoc indexes and the wadex the paper discusses improvements and variations to the kwic index such as manipulation of the index line variations of the code addition of classification information combination of author index and title index and improvements to the preparation of the kwic indexes such as improvement of titles and use of a thesaurus and discusses improvement of the use of the kwic index the paper discusses the usage of the kwic index and comments on the future of kwic indexes of the kwic concept,

55,56.0,computer produced micro library catalog kozumplik  lange  the philosophy production and cost effectiveness of a computer generated library catalog is described this catalog is unique in that it utilizes direct computer to microfilm composition techniques employing the stromberg carlson 4020 cost user acceptance and by product capabilities are stressed,
56,57.0,distribution of indexing terms for maximum efficiency of information transmission slamecka  a function was developed for the optimum distribution of indexing terms by the number of postings this makes it possible to transmit information with maximum efficiency the comparison of the actual distribution of the term groups with the calculated optimum distribution provides an objective measure for evaluating any indexing system with respect to its efficiency as information transmission channel,
57,58.0,relevance disagreements and unclear request forms o connor  disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents requests may be differently interpreted because they are unclear well known types of request obscurity are reviewed less well known is that a request may be unclear because its form documents about subject s document answering question q etc is unclear explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given and several others a request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified way examples are given which suggest that some perhaps all about s requests are unclear some ways of formulating clear question requests are given various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished these depend on on such factors as parts of a document use inference strength and background knowledge permitted some possible clear support specifications are indicated,
58,59.0,opinion paper savage  although a large number of selective dissemination of information sdi systems have been planned implemented and tested over the past few years insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of important data needed for evaluation we describe some of the defects common to almost all of the reported systems single out one recent report for detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor,
59,60.0,information science what is it borko  in seeking a new sense of identity we ask in this article the question what is information science what does the information science do tentative answers to these questions are given in the hope of simulating discussion that will help clarify the nature of our field and our work,
60,61.0,expected search length a single measure of retrieval effectiveness based on the work ordering action of retrieval systems cooper  a measure of document retrieval system performance called the expected search length reduction factor is defined and compared with indicators such as precision and recall that have been suggested by other workers the new measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired number of relevant documents could be found its advantages are 1 it provides a single index of the property it attempts to measure 2 it allows for gradations of retrieval status through the mathematical concept of a weak ordering 3 it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching and 4 it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the requester,
61,62.0,a literature search and file organization model leimkuhler  a principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target detection with the effort expended thus far as an application of this principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file the file items should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will yield the information sought complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency a model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern in this way trade off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated a representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the bradford law of scattering this function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies it is shown that a good two zone search plan to scientific literature is one in which 15 20 of the most useful documents are examined first only about one of three searches should have to go on to a search over the remainder of the file,
62,63.0,the publication inflation london  the much vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a rather generalized publication inflation multipublication and pretentious writing have become obstacles to communication between human minds to counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before it is stored for retrieval,
63,64.0,a computer based serials control system for a large biomedical library roper  rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in creating a computer system for control of serials in this paper the author deals with the concept upon which the ucla system is based and the manner in which the system is maintained in day to day operations of the ucla biomedical library the paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication from the ucla serials project the attempt is to show how the theory of publication pattern discussed in the earlier article has been used to produce a different idea in computer control of serials publication pattern information which is entered into the master record for each title causes check in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the computer regardless of when this text issue is expected next week next month next year this is departure from most systems which attempt to predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time period the information which must be a part of the computer record is described as are library procedures in maintaining the system,
64,65.0,a study of searching the eye research literature miller  the paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching the periodical eye research literature questions were collected from eye researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different secondary sources articles thought to be relevant were xeroxed and sent to the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles articles of eye research interest are found in a wide variety of journals but a small number of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye researchers approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign languages translations are not readily available despite a delay of more than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the mailing of photocopies about half of the articles of interest to the researchers were not known to them previously for extensive retrospective searches more than one secondary service must be used index medicus and excerpta medica section 12 or ophthalmic literature would be good sources medlars demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual searches of index medicus titles abstracts and full text were shown to be equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers a searcher with a background in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than other non ophthalmologist searchers,
65,66.0,psychology and information miller  an aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate information spatially computer based systems do not necessarily assign any unique role to spatial tags and so a feature of considerable importance for the organization of the user s memory seems to have been largely overlooked the spatial dimension of human memory is discussed and some suggestions are offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information retrieval services,
66,67.0,the use of simulation in studying information storage and retrieval systems nance  previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval systems isrs have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to consider the environment within which such systems operate this paper considers the isrs as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the users and the funders of the retrieval system the three components form a closed loop information feedback system in which user response influences both the funding and operation of the isrs as it attempts to satisfy user needs within a finite budget allocation reward cost theory provides the basis for describing user behavior an industrial dynamics model has been developed to simulate isrs user funder behavior where a university departmental library is the isrs component the results which such an analysis can produce are discussed,
67,68.0,retrieval of answer providing documents o connor  i better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied separately this paper is concerned with retrieval of documents in response to a question from which answers to that question can be inferred answer providing documents answer can be inferred from document has many possible meanings one of which must be selected an inference specification inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences have somewhat different background knowledge etc any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices two sources of systematic knowledge of document statement inference practices in a scientific field are described ii if a content word occurs in a question then it occurs in any answer to that question with some apparently tractable exceptions an indexing procedure based on that fact is described which would permit retrieval of all answer providing documents for a question however because the indexing is nonrelational it could cause false retrievals as well various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are briefly indicated and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them two special point concerning indexing for retrieval of answer providing documents are discussed separately,
68,69.0,statistical generation of a technical vocabulary stone  the results of an experiment in the use of statistical techniques for extracting a technical vocabulary from document texts are presented and discussed,
69,70.0,on understanding user choices textual correlates of relevance judgements baumanis  an empirical investigation of the role of documents in relevance judgements is reported abstracts previously judged relevant partially relevant and nonrelevant to each of 61 questions were compared to see whether textual differences could be found which might reasonably account for the rating differences the results of this comparison were fairly clear cut characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts these characterizations were found to be expressible largely as meaningful co occurrences of terms closely related to the question it is suggested that the textual bases of user choices may be more understandable than has been supposed,
70,71.0,word word associations in document retrieval systems lesk  the smart automatic document retrieval system is used to study association procedures for automatic content analysis the effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections there is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent the use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall by permitting new matches between requests and documents but also precision by reinforcing existing matches in our experiments the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations a properly constructed thesaurus however offers better performance than statistical association methods,
71,72.0,a comparison between manual and automatic indexing methods salton  the effectiveness of conventional document indexing is compared with that achievable by fully automatic text processing methods evaluation results are given for a comparison between the medlars search system used at the national library of medicine and the experimental smart system and conclusions are reached concerning the design of future automatic information systems,
72,73.0,effectiveness of information retrieval methods swets  results of some 50 different retrieval methods applied in three experimental retrieval systems were subjected to the analysis suggested by statistical decision theory the analysis validates a previously proposed measure of effectiveness and demonstrates its several desirable properties the examination of a wide range of data in relation to this one metric provides a clear and general assessment of the current state of the retrieval art,
73,74.0,managerial cost accounting for a technical information center helmkamp  the purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a technical center to test the hypothesis that a theoretically sound managerial cost accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by other enterprises a computerized cost system was developed and operated for a three month period to test this hypothesis the results of the study indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical information center relevant cost information was generated periodically to measure the operating performance of the center s production process a summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented in this paper,
74,75.0,medlars report on the evaluation of its operating efficiency lancaster  a comprehensive program to evaluate the performance of medlars was conducted by the national library of medicine in 1966 and 1967 this report describes the methodology used and presents a summary of the principal results conclusions and recommendations,
75,76.0,biomedical literature analysis of journal articles collected by a radiation and cell biologist leith  the author s journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed according to three interest patterns i the total collection of 1469 article titles a potentially useful set ii a subset concerning only his research speciality and iii a subset of articles defined as useful for each pattern journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram was drawn patterns i and ii largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers pattern iii was more widely scattered it is concluded that access to diverse journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas and that this diversity of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect means current contents used by the author for current awareness purposes in building his card file generated 88 of all articles scatter diagrams indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use the 30 most important journals in this collection including about 80 of titles are ranked for each pattern,
76,77.0,the effectiveness of automatically generated weights and links in mechanical indexing wolf  work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the medico automatic indexing method is described the statistical test were designed primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers this evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles,
77,78.0,on line access to information nsf as an aid to the indexer cataloger bennet  when adding a document to a collection an indexer should choose a representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its relation to other documents already in the collection toward this end the negotiated search facility nsf makes possible indexer controlled retrieval of information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a traditional bibliographic catalog the design philosophy of nsf is to offer a framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data which he judges will help him make indexing decisions an example which indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display formats and command language promote interaction while the discussion is directed toward indexing it should be clear that the facility would be equally useful to the searcher,
78,79.0,computer selection of keywords using word frequency analysis roeloffs  a statistically based method for automatically identifying keywords in machine readable text has been developed which produces keyword lists that agree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do lists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested and also better than lists produced by most of the individual panel members the method makes use of both the in document word occurrence frequency and the in corpus relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance each statistical criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank correlation statistics the simple word count was found to be superior to the other four previously suggested criteria all of which made use of the in corpus relative occurrence frequency the test were conducted over 19 documents dealing with the subject of information science a total of over 66 000 word occurrences seventeen indexers representing eight different information centers participated in experiments,
79,80.0,a graphic catalog card index lewis  to improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the united states military academy library at west point a model card with a graphic image of the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed directly above a black and white opaque photo and also key punched into it the card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides and can produce a subject arranged permuted index in book form the later permits access from the approach of form geographic area name time of origin artist school or style etc some added advantages common to other kinds of graphic collections are detailed estimated costs of photo reproduction of original cards various kinds of copies and computer time and materials are listed future benefits from a consistent unified cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of information in a network structure are indicated as major goals,
80,81.0,indexing consistency and quality dexter  a measure of indexing consistency is developed based on the concept of fuzzy sets it assigns a higher consistency value if indexers agree on the more important terms measures of the quality of an indexer s work and exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed experimental data on indexing consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers and consistency quality and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed the analysis of indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to bradford s law of information scattering lotka s law of scientific productivity and zipf s law of vocabulary distribution,
81,82.0,is interindexer consistency a hobgoblin cooper  it is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the indexing to explore this assumption two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality a specific counter example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected it is concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived measurements of inter indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to indexing quality,
82,83.0,the cost analysis of document surrogation a literature review landau  a state of the art literature review on the cost of classification cataloging indexing and abstracting has been included it was found that while some data on specific costs are available the literature is generally found lacking from the point of view of accuracy completeness consistency and availability,
83,84.0,some independent agreements and resolved disagreements about answer providing documents o connor  eighty two documents and 30 questions in documentation and related areas was compared to find answer providing documents documents from which answers to questions can be inferred two judges documentation experts made comparisons independently they discussed their disagreements attempting to resolve them in each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what answer he inferred and from what document passage s the further discussion depended on the details of each case in general the resolution procedures used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer providing or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement about a passage s meaning a statement s correctness or an inference s correctness this seems better than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to rational discussion,
84,85.0,information science toward the development of a true scientific discipline yovits  it is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a true science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way in several previous papers the author and a colleague have described a model of a generalized information system which has wide and perhaps universal applicability this paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of its applicability several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in a way which allows for quantification it is pointed out in this paper that this model can be the basis for the development of a true science of information with all of the necessary requirements for a science by the use of this model and the definition of a true science the goals and requirements for a curriculum in information science are thus established within this context information is defined as data of value in decision making quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to specific observable actions which can be measured physically,
85,86.0,a comparison of a keyword from title index with a single access point per document alphabetic subject index stursa  two indexes to a collection of 3 204 documents in the field of chemistry were test searched the indexes are a keyword from title index without added keywords and a single access point per document alphabetic subject index the indexes were searched by 13 graduate chemistry students using 55 questions search results are characterized in terms of recall precision and search time there is no statistically significant difference in recall and precision search result between the multiple access points per document keyword from title index and the single access point per document alphabetic subject index search time was significantly better for the alphabetic subject index for all but those questions having only one relevant document,
86,87.0,a core nursing library for practitioners stearns  ratcliff  getchell  zeller  the following books and journals for the core nursing library suggested reference materials and supplementary books and journals were selected by experts in nursing from all parts of the united states the purpose is to let practitioners and community hospitals know which books and journals from a wealth of printed material would in the opinion of experts be most useful especially where funds and space are limited,
87,88.0,patterns of name ordering among authors of scientific papers a study of social symbolism and its ambiguity zuckerman  with increasing scientific collaboration visibility of individual role performance has diminished ordering of author names as an adaptive device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research interviews with nobel laureates and comparisons of their name order practices to those of other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of individual role performance difficult a probability model of expected distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular sequences and these preferences vary with the authors eminence on the assumptions that authors names are listed in order of the value of their contributions laureates should be first authors more often than other scientists in fact they are not instead they exercise their noblesse oblige by giving credit to less eminent co workers increasingly as their eminence grows they do so more often after the prize and eminent laureates to be forego first authorship more often than those as yet unrecognized the noblesse oblige however has its limits laureates contributions to prize winning research are more visible than contributions to their other research,
88,89.0,professional standing and the reception of scientific discoveries cole  the matthew effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators in this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work if the matthew effect were to operate the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system to test this hypothesis data are drawn from several studies of similar design in each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2 this enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2 we then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author s location in the stratification system all the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper s initial reception than any of the stratification variables however the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery the matthew effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science all other stratification variables including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low ranking scientists the matthew effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame a discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries,
89,90.0,involving computerizing personalizing kilgour  in most libraries most users face a complex monolithic arrangement of entries in catalogs and books on shelves in classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user a user is unidentified and except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians users remain nameless the computer however with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one librarian libraries however rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives contemporary living is information based a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function as small special libraries already do all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid service libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques,
90,91.0,williams wilkins the great leap backward north  this article contains a call for active participation by all segments of the library and educational community in the williams and wilkins controversy and in the effort to achieve appropriate copyright revision,
91,92.0,oclc for you and me plotnick  sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps those who seem to know all about this thing called oclc and who keep popping that rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence and the other camp plain folk who are happy to take library life one acronym at a time as they need it and who if pressed might guess that oclc has something to do with oh optical codes at the library of congress only in ohio where the ohio college library center began and where this national computerized bibliographic data exchange continues to grow is oclc universally a library household term even among computer phobes in ohio most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at oclc is not simply the building up of someone else s data base in little bits and bytes but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books were unchained from the shelves,
92,93.0,the american occupational structure blau  this book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven years we have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to make there is no senior author the sequence of name is simply alphabetical and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere to emphasize this fact our collaboration was motivated by our shared interest in social stratification our common concern with advancing scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research and the conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications and viewpoints the two of us represent there can be no doubt that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to a considerable degree although we agree that refining research methods and advancing social theory are both important for example it is only fair to state that duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical generalizations,
93,94.0,american overseas library technical assistance 1940 1970 brewster  the united states has been engaged in activities known variously as technical assistance technical cooperation or development assistance for the past twenty five years this form of foreign aid either government sponsored or privately supported is a twentieth century phenomenon the broader concept foreign aid or foreign assistance means providing another country with any kind of goods whether financial commodity or manpower to almost any purpose and extends to antiquity technical assistance which may be defined on the other hand as the supplying of techniques is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels america s rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field began to develop under president roosevelt s good neighbor policy this integration soon expanded under the new cultural relations program which the united states implemented during world war ii to offset the nazi propaganda and cultural offensive in latin america,
94,95.0,scientific communication five themes from social science research menzel  the recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources a theoretical one in the development of communication research and a practical one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and information services for some time past the attention of sociologists and social psychologists studying communication processes once focused on so called mass phenomena and mass publics has turned to the interplay of communication processes with more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure one aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized sort and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information the scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the publics so studied,
95,96.0,communication patterns in applied technology marquis  allen  the preceding papers have addressed themselves to the study of information flow in a particular stream of human activity which has been variously called science pure science basic research or fundamental research and which is only secondarily if at all concerned with the practical utilization of its products at this point it is appropriate to note that there is a parallel activity which includes applied research exploratory development and engineering development this second stream of research we will call technology far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists from the knowledge that is available however we are led to conclude that the communication patterns in the two areas of activity are not only largely independent of one another but qualitatively different in their nature this difference is reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by which information is diffused within the two sets of practitioners the present paper is addressed to these differences and to a discussion of the nature of the communication process between science and technology,
96,97.0,bibliographical citation characteristics of the psychological journal network in 1950 and in 1960 xhignesse  osgood  the aforementioned studies are related to the problem of information exchange in psychology journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific communication as well as storage elements for the summary accounts of research undertakings analysis of bibliographical citations thus can reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of information flow created by scientists in their work the potential usefulness of this type of investigation is increased when it becomes possible to examine the trends through time of the communication network under consideration and also when different communication networks can be compared the present paper deals with some of the characteristics of bibliographical citations in the same 21 psychological journals published both in 1950 and in 1960 the list of journals used along with the abbreviations to be used here is given in table 1 it includes 8 journals published by the american psychological association and 13 journals published by other organizations,
97,98.0,scientific communication its role in the conduct of research and creation of knowledge garvey  griffith  there is considerable apprehension today within the scientific community over the communication crisis in science the present article which attempts to clarify certain aspects of the problem overviews the data collected by the apa project on scientific information exchange in psychology together with data which we have more recently obtained relative to other disciplines such a reexamination of the data should help to clarify apa s relationship to the many information media involved in the communication process which begins with research and ends with the incorporation of research findings into psychological knowledge,
98,99.0,ecological correlations and the behavior of individuals robinson  an individual correlation is a correlation in which the statistical object or thing described is indivisible the correlation between color and illiteracy for persons in the united states shown later in table 1 is an individual correlation because the kind of thing described is an indivisible unit a person in an individual correlation the variables are descriptive properties of individuals such as height income eye color or race and not descriptive statistical constants such as rates or means in an ecological correlation the statistical object is a group of persons the correlation between the percentage of the population which is negro and the percentage of the population which is illiterate for the 48 states shown later as figure 2 is an ecological correlation the thing described is the population of a state and not a single individual the variables are percentages descriptive properties of groups and not descriptive properties of individuals,
99,100.0,priorities in scientific discovery a chapter in the sociology of science merton  we can only guess what historians of the future will say about the condition of present day sociology but it seems safe to anticipate one of their observations when the trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history as they well might for this clan of historians promises to go on forever they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists and historians of the twentieth century could bring themselves in their work to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time they will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival they may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled,
100,101.0,social factors in the origins of a new science the case of psychology collins  the uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field therefore the new idea is not sufficient to start the take off into sustained growth in a new field a new role must be created as well in scientific psychology this occurred in the late nineteenth century in germany using germany as a positive case and france britain and the united states as negative cases it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of the human mind into an experimental science,
101,102.0,scientific output and recognition a study in the operation of the reward system in science cole  the relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of 120 university physicists was studied although these two variables are highly correlated some physicists produce many papers of little significance and other produce a few papers of great significance the responses of the community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were investigated quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting recognition through the receipt of awards appointment to prestigious academic departments and being widely known to one s colleagues the reward system operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive to divert the energies of less creative physicists into other channels and to produce a higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments than in the weaker departments,
102,103.0,nobel laureates in science patterns of productivity collaboration and authorship zuckerman  nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than a matched sample of scientists interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the life work cycle as laureates report and as their publications collaborate they exercise noblesse oblige in arranging co authorship in collaborative publications receipt of the nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work practices as a result of changed role obligations and activities reductions in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already eminent the prize generates strain in collaborative associations so that most of these terminate soon after the award,
103,104.0,visibility and the structural bases of awareness of scientific research cole  the paper contains an analysis of several aspects of the communication process in science using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires mailed to university physicists the conditions making for high visibility of a scientists work are studied four strong determinates of visibility were found the quality of work as measured by citations the honorific awards received for work in physics the prestige of the physics department to which the scientist belong and speciality quantity of output age and name ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility just as some physicists may be easily seen i e have high visibility other are in positions where they may easily see this latter characteristic is called awareness the data indicate that awareness is high in all sectors of the population studied variables such as age rank of department and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness we conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently,
104,105.0,social structure in a group of scientists a test of the invisible college hypothesis crane  the existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred a if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one another than with scientists who have not published and b scientists who have published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social participation within the area using the mail questionnaire sociometric data on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists all of whom had published in a particular problem area respondents chose scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists within the area analysis of direct and indirect ties using cleman s method for analysis of sociometric connectedness revealed that a tie with one or more of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less productivity into a large network of influence and communication similarities between this type of social organization and that of the social circle are discussed,
105,106.0,growth and decay curves in scientific citations model  articles  in a rapidly advancing scientific discipline new contributions will supersede older ones this selection in favor of recent literature should be observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline by age of article cited however the age distribution of citations also depends on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature the effect of growth of the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated if certain assumptions hold by use of an exponential model that expands and clarifies earlier findings by price this model provides a reasonably good fit to age distributions of footnotes in several disciplines and its application suggest that citations in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences,
106,107.0,the structure of scientific fields and the functioning of university graduate departments gordon  kuhn s concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed as technologies involving degree of task predictability a series of hypotheses were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of communication and access to stored information using questionnaire data collected from 80 university graduate departments physicists and chemists were found to exhibit more agreement over field content and to be more willing and satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political scientists in addition chemists were found to collaborate with larger numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed the level of innovation being pursued within a field of a given time and the degree of institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines,
107,108.0,productivity differences among scientists evidence for accumulative advantage stewart  the highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage because of feedback through recognition and resources highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on a major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages cross sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists physicists and mathematicians who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age this increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated the association among productivity resources and esteem increases as career age increases,
108,109.0,the distribution of social and cultural properties in informal communication networks among biological scientists mullins  informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible social structure this research analyzes the relation of that structure to 1 scientists descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie those descriptions 2 social status in science and 3 the formal social categories of science i e discipline department and research organization each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model neither social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model the culture of science on the other hand as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying those descriptions shows very strong associations with the discerned network structures,
109,110.0,the gatekeepers of science some factors affecting the selection of articles of scientific journals crane  the norms of scientific behavior as described by merton include the prescription that scientific achievements are to be judged without reference to scientists social characteristics this article will attempt to assess the extent to which this norm is followed with respect to the evaluation of articles by scientific journals,
110,111.0,bibliographical reference patterns in core sociological journals 1965 1966 lin  nelson  the present study attempted to extend previous work on bibliographical reference patterns in sociological journals in the following ways 1 by selecting for study those journals to which american sociologists prefer to submit their work 2 by including over a two year period all bibliographical references journals books technical reports etc and 3 by including for initial comparison a journal from the physical sciences such a study it was hoped would yield data concerning similarities and differences among the sociological journals and between the sociological journals and the physical science journal,
111,112.0,sociology today lacunae emphases and surfeits brown  gilmartin  in sociology today as in other sciences the professional journals serve as major channels for the dissemination of ideas and information the papers presented in the principal periodicals reach a wide audience among sociologists are acknowledged as the best work and stand as models for all who aspire to success the viewpoints conceptual schemes interests and methodologies reflected in these articles are therefore significant influences on both the current character and the future development of our discipline,
112,113.0,measuring the quality of sociological research problems in the use of the science citation index cole  the problem of assessing the quality of scientific publications has long been a major impediment to progress in the sociology of science most researchers have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone ahead and used publication counts anyway coler 1963 crane 1965 price 1963 wilson 1964 there seemed to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large numbers of papers or the life s work of large numbers of scientists the invention of the science citation index sci a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool to measure the significance of individual scientists contributions starting in 1961 the sci has listed all bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large number of journals the number of citations an individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator of the relative scientific significance or quality of that individual s publications,
113,114.0,the analysis of information systems meadow  this book is intended to supply the background needed for participation in the analysis and design of information handling systems and for understanding the literature in the field i have tried to present a unified approach to the subject and to the relation of information retrieval to other disciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this interdisciplinary relationship i hope that the scientist or computer programmer newly interested in information retrieval problems as well as the librarian will find the book of value,
114,115.0,analysis of library user circulation requirements trueswell  this research study is concerned with the use of the last circulation date as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements some decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining the number of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in the weeding of books from the library s holdings the effect of these decision rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations are described the method of data collection is described in detail and is applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems cumulative distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation data and stack holding data this same data has also been plotted by subdivided subject category circulation operating characteristics were prepared for all three libraries,
115,116.0,the documentation of chemical research vaupel  due to the fact that scientific technical research is constantly increasing it is becoming more and more difficult to retrieve the published results of research a new field of science documentation has been developed as a contribution to the removal of this difficulty depending on the type and extent of the subject different methods for its documentation will be followed methods and possibilities for the comprehensive documentation of chemistry and its related fields are explained,
116,117.0,tosar a topological method for the representation of synthetic and analytical relations of concepts fugmann  nickelsen  nickelsen  winter  in mechanized systems used for searching in literature stores there is a steadily growing necessity not only to be able to formulate concepts as a search condition but also the characteristic connections under which these concepts appear in the inquiry in this way the precision of the mechanized literature search is considerably increased tosar has been developed in order to improve computerized literature searching in this respect,
117,118.0,animal dispersion in relation to social behavior wynneedwards  the theory presented in this book links together the subjects of population and brhavior it applies to animals in general which gives it an exceedingly wide scope,
118,119.0,information networks becker  olsen  in the literature active network plans and developments appear to cluster in three main areas 1 education 2 libraries and 3 government industry and professional societies these network groupings are described in this chapter following a discussion of network definitions concepts and current impetus references to information systems are included when there is an indication that a particular system will probably be transformed into a network,
119,120.0,design and evaluation of information systems katter  in corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of content coverage the initial emphasis was on design and evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely and narrowly connected with information storage and retrieval systems it is becoming increasingly clear however that there are many activities and ideas outside of this context that have or can have a very important bearing on the work of systems analysts designers and evaluators working on library and documentation systems this chapter attempts to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which our readers are chiefly interested,
120,121.0,document dissemination landau  this chapter is directed to those whose vocation or avocation is information while we may call ourselves librarians information scientists or technologists abstractors and indexers documentalists is r specialists literature searchers and so forth we all have one thing in common we are either directly or indirectly involved in the dissemination of information as disseminators we are interested in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from one point to another despite mcluhan s 93 statement that the medium is the message we must concern ourselves with not only the means of document dissemination but also the content and value of the documents we disseminate this idea is prevalent throughout most of the papers reviewed in this chapter a disseminator should think of himself as a selective switching center inputting data evaluating them selecting worthy items and directing and controlling their transmission to a target the reader,
121,122.0,information networks overhage  the rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and used in our complex society has presented us with major problems in information transfer we encounter these problems not only in libraries information centers and schools but also in many of the operations of government and business the handling of large amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management of our way of life we are a technologically oriented society and we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help us perform our enormous information transfer task beginning with the telegraph and continuing through the telephone through radio and television to the communications satellite the methods of electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information to its ultimate users,
122,123.0,annual reviews of information science and technology cuadra  in spite of concerns expressed in the literature about the health and vigor of the field of information science and of its service oriented institutions libraries and information centers the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for optimism some of the trends that were commented on in volume 6 have proved to be solid and important for example the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally or regionally held data three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement bennett s review of the user interface in interactive systems gechman s report on machine readable bibliographic data bases and brandhorst and eckert s review of document retrieval and dissemination systems this volume also introduces a new annual review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries video cartridges and cassettes it is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will in the coming years shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media and the chapter by kletter and hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities in addition to these topics this volume covers three of the core areas of information science which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible information needs and uses document description and representation and organization of information this coverage is consistent with a newly developed annual review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science,1972-01-01 00:00:00
123,124.0,the user interface in interactive systems bennett  the digital computer has been used as a problem solving tool for only two decades during most of this time computer scientists have concentrated on learning how to build the tool applying electronic technology arranging for data flow between components and manufacturing the hardware now we are entering a new stage in which computing power is made available through interactive terminals to people who are not computer scientists this is possible on a large scale only because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their ability to provide reliable cost effective service to less sophisticated users in this new stage the natural behavior patterns of users become an important element in the design of the interface to the tool,
124,125.0,machine readable bibliographic data bases gechman  the advent of machine readable data bases is one of the most significant forward steps in information retrieval currently the creation and application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth this reviewer sees a great need for a review of what is going on because there is so much going on it is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful look,
125,126.0,annual reviews of information science and technology cuadra  the major trends of the 1970 s in information system planning and services are becoming clear as indicated in this year s annual review chapters the movement toward inter institutional operations or networking began gaining force in the 1965 1970 period through the establishment of many new library consortia and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information utilities these movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost effective productive ventures inter institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions but also poses new problems and demands formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups it also requires more careful and productive system planning and design including intelligent consideration of the make versus buy issue several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations one of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on line information retrieval services both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector the apparent cost effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials namely how to cover rising costs in the face of declining or less rapidly growing sales of individual units of the product monographs serials secondary information publications or magnetic tapes the inclusion of a chapter on copyright the first in the annual review series reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information another aspect of that controversy the role of government and non profit information services in relation to those of private industry is explored in this year s chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques,1974-01-01 00:00:00
126,127.0,use of machine readable data bases williams  this is the first annual review chapter entitled use of machine readable data bases therefore the coverage provided is for more than a one year period a chapter by gechman 79 on machine readable bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971 a chapter by housman 100 covered the use of data bases for selective dissemination of information sdi and a chapter by parkins kennedy 153 has previously reviewed secondary information services this chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier data base papers not treated in prior chapters for purposes of this chapter a data base is considered to be an organized set of machine readable records containing bibliographic or document related data,
127,128.0,design and evaluation of information systems swanson  the co joining of design with evaluation that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion exclusion problems for the author in part design and evaluation prescribe two separate sets of activities the former pertaining to the planning development and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components however design includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations evaluation applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs as well as to the appraisal of operating systems appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment thus portions of design and evaluation are closely interrelated as katter demonstrated in his 1969 review design and evaluation may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies increasingly designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations the current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products,
128,129.0,generation and uses of machine readable data bases schipma  this chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine readable data bases inaugurated in volume 9 by williams 178 it is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with williams s initial compilation the same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in volume 9 are continued this year a data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine readable records containing bibliographic and or document related data e g index information the data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation the choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas first data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information such as chemical structures milen et al 112 are excluded thus even though the chemical abstracts service cas registry number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases papers such as that by cas regarding progress in building the registry system itself 39 are excluded similarly though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the systems consultants inc report 156 to the navy most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter finally though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting we are not considering that production operation,
129,130.0,cooperation in information activities through international organizations adams  werdel j a  international cooperation in the processing sharing and transfer of scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be accomplished through many agencies this chapter proposes to review the role played by international organizations in stimulating and providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation the international organizations to be discussed are of two types intergovernmental organizations igos in which member nations participate through their governments under formal treaties or agreements and nongovernmental organizations ngos where with some exceptions participation is through national professional societies or nongovernmental institutions the specialized agencies of the united nations including unesco fall in the first category organizations such as the international federation for documentation fid are in the second,
130,131.0,introduction to the adi annual review cuadra  over the past 15 or 20 years a new and growing field of inquiry has begun to take shape this field which will be referred to as information science and technology draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences technologies disciplines arts and practices the element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with information its generation transformation communication storage retrieval and use because of the universality of information processes and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them there is very little agreement about the boundaries of information science and technology or about its parentage its essential nature or its future to put it simply at the present time there is no clearly defined and well understood field of information science and technology there is not truth to tell even clear agreement on what the word information itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents transported and exchanged distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users designers and students of information systems and services the purpose of the adi annual review series initiated in this volume is to provide such a review,1966-01-01 00:00:00
131,132.0,information needs and uses in science and technology menzel  the way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information systems at their disposal the demands that they put to them the satisfaction achieved by their efforts and the resultant impact on their further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise planning of science information systems and policy besides these matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested in human organization and communication while user studies have not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions the end of 1963 seems to have been something of a take off point for empirical research on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists for this first volume of the annual review we shall therefore cover studies that made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963 to give the reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research has witnessed progress along the following lines substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application of a technique critical incidents that had made its appearance in this field earlier in less rigorous forms the introduction of at least two very promising approaches solution development records comparison of research teams working on identical tasks quite different from any that had been applied to this field before and an increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the information flow situation in given disciplines one of which american psychological association 3 has become the model and envy of research in this area,
132,133.0,the annual review of information science and technology cuadra  this volume is the second in a series of annual reviews of progress in the field of information science and technology like its predecessor it attempts to describe compare and evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field during the past year the effort has been undertaken in the belief that such taking stock of accomplishments provides a valuable service to the specialists in the information science field the chapters on new techniques for publication and distribution of information on new developments in chemical documentation and on applications in medicine,1967-01-01 00:00:00
133,134.0,evaluation of information systems and services rees  this chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in testing and evaluation three tasks will be undertaken to outline in some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and evaluation to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to testing and evaluation and finally to provide some general conclusions with respect to past and future activity although a distinction is made in this review between laboratory based experimentation and tests of operational systems the methodology used in each instance is substantially the same as yet no full scale and elaborate field approach has been attempted,
134,135.0,design of information systems and services borko  this review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design of information systems literature dealing with the automation of libraries and information centers has been explicitly excluded while material on user studies file organization evaluation etc is only mentioned briefly since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters the selected relevant and available literature that has been published in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows 1 articles that help define the process of systems analysis and the relationship to information science 2 articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as applied to the analysis and design of information systems 3 articles primarily concerned with the design of document storage and retrieval systems,
135,136.0,the annual review of information science and technology cuadra  the annual review of information science and technology is now in its third year like its two predecessors this volume attempts to describe and evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field during the past year with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards and our means of professional communication the field of information science and technology continues to evolve and grow as it does new areas of interest emerge and established areas of interest change in importance accordingly our pattern of coverage changes the single chapter on automation in libraries and information centers in volume 2 has been expanded into two chapters one covering automation of technical processes and the other covering document networks and a new chapter has been added on information system applications in education such applications are important not just because they involve in part libraries and other information facilities but because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of value to anyone interested in the total communication process at the same time core chapters of the review are continued information needs and uses content analysis specification and control file organization and search publication and distribution techniques automated language processing man machine communication information system design and evaluation and professional aspects of information science these topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers and their annual literature is significant large and growing,1968-01-01 00:00:00
136,137.0,information needs and uses paisley  information science meets behavioral science in the study of information needs and uses at first the meeting of these fields was inconclusive until the mid 1960 s there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses since about 1963 however a significant literature has grown rapidly there is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields when information scientists see reliable valid and nontrivial data on users behavior they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance when behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination documentation storage and retrieval processes they offer fewer naive solutions to the information problem this mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue information science and behavioral science need each other big science needs them both,
137,138.0,the annual review of information science and technology cuadra  this the fourth volume of the annual review of information science and technology is both like and unlike its predecessors the basic objective to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review ever prepared in the information science field remains the same as do the basic areas of interest and coverage too the primary emphasis continues to be on published literature and reports to permit the reader to identify locate and examine interesting and important sources of information about various aspects of our technical progress some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year for the first time a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on the international aspects of information transfer have been included also the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services usually covered in parts of other chapters have full and separate chapters this year another change made in response to suggestions from readers for better signposts within each volume is the division of the book into several major segments each introduced by a short description of the contents of the section the relationships among the chapters within it and in some instances one or two highlights of the year s technical progress,1969-01-01 00:00:00
138,139.0,information needs and uses allen  previous authors in this series writing on this subject have usually felt it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the methodology of user studies they have for the most part found it improved over the past and this year is no exception in that regard there remains however the tendency on the part of many who are untrained in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can master in a single attempt one never realizes how truly wrong this view is until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers,
139,140.0,annual review of information science and technology cuadra  the field of information science and technology continues to grow and as it grows to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest volume 5 reflects these changes the increasing interest in and movement toward library networks and other cooperative technology supported information activities have helped to focus special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology the two traditional mainstays of library and document handling systems but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele communications thus a chapter on communication technology has appeared for the first time to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use information handling systems two other first time chapters cover management information systems and information systems in state and local government while the intent behind the development of such systems and the kinds of services they provide is peripheral to the purposes and services of library and document handling systems one often sees in these peripheral areas some information parallels indeed one of the reasons for the annual review s covering one or more of these areas each year is to help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem solving techniques they are fostering,1970-01-01 00:00:00
140,141.0,application of computer technology to library process a syllabus becker  the application of computer technology to library and network processes and services is not an end in itself but rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand for library services and the ability of libraries to provide those services libraries have assumed the active role of serving the informational educational and recreational needs of the population the size of that population grows constantly its educational level keeps climbing and its percentage of leisure time is increasing the application of computer technology to libraries especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment it cannot be accomplished by either profession alone rather the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians computer system analysts and programmers even a limited effort demands careful long term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole the smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library for these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about,
141,142.0,archives and library relations clark  a distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and record knowledge the tools of communication have ranged from clay to satellites civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this purpose the importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented without information and its necessary control a society is not only stagnant but regressive with social memory preserved and controlled by archives and libraries a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever changing environment archives were the forerunners of libraries the ancient archives contained the best of society s accumulated knowledge and as nations grew in wealth and security archives and libraries become symbols of a country s aspiration to create a better society today archives and libraries are necessities these cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media in this way archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals the materials in these institutions contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions develop policies ascertain rights educate and entertain,
142,143.0,the area specialist bibliographer an inquiry into his role stuart  it is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and to improve administrative procedures for future development of area programs this will be accomplished by giving some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence these opinions these attitudes will be presented by the perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that role the bibliographer s academic professional and educational experience will be examined in this framework,
143,144.0,the art of computer programming knuth  the process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically rewarding it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music this book is the first volume of a seven volume set of books that has been designed to train the reader in the various skills which go into a programmer s craft,
144,145.0,asidic survey of information center services williams  the data in that survey covered the year 1971 many recipients of the 1972 document have requested updated information accordingly the asidic cooperative data management committee initiated a new survey the questionnaires were mailed out in january of 1975 and responses came in throughout the year questionnaires were sent to all member organizations of asidic and eusidic questionnaires were also sent to individual members of asis sig sdi and sig uoi responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in 1976 because of the time delay in producing the final compilation the reader is warned against using this survey as an up to date source for information as to which centers are processing which data bases of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and 41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers of the 75 that process data bases i e spin tapes 51 68 are members of asidic and or eusidic this survey provides representative data for data base processing organizations the use of online search services was relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be representative of the 1976 online situation,
145,146.0,the testing of index language devices cleverdon  mills  in this paper we set out the fundamental operations involved in compiling and using an index show how the various factors can influence the operating efficiency and consider the methods to be used in the present aslib cranfield investigation,
146,147.0,research on users needs where is it getting us hanson  since bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature for the 1948 royal society scientific information conference at least three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of scientists and engineers for information of their information gathering habits and the use to which they put information some of these have been concerned with the people in individual organizations but have implications elsewhere others including aslib s own investigations have had wider aims some have been based upon observations and records of what the scientists and engineers themselves did or said and some upon records of the demands they made upon libraries there have been both surveys of opinions and collections of facts,
147,148.0,fair fast access information retrieval project aims and methods pickford  i am going to describe in general terms a research project which has been established to explore some of the problems of the use of the literature particularly in the field of biomedical engineering of the national institute for medical research hampstead laboratories the project is scheduled to last for three years and like most research consists of a number of overlapping stages we have reached the stage now of having acquired sufficient equipment and data to start trying out some of our ideas,
148,149.0,the cranfield tests on index language devices cleverdon  the investigation dealt with the effect which different devices have on the performance of index languages it appeared that the most important consideration was the specificity of the index terms within the context of the conditions existing in this test single word terms were more effective than concept terms or a controlled vocabulary,
149,150.0,current awareness searches on ct cbas and asca abbot  hunter  simkins  during the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the chemical society s experiment on the use of routine computer searches of chemical titles ct and chemical biological activities cbac for current awareness for some time we have also been subscribing to the automatic subject citation alert asca which is produced by the institute for scientific information as a by product of the science citation index these three sources differ in their scope and methods but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer based current awareness service ct covers journals in all branches of chemistry but provides only authors and titles the latter translated into american and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved cbac covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems but provides abstracts which are available for computer search the computer can also search for molecular formulae and for chemical abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts asca in its original form was based on citations the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work last spring asca introduced a term search which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a ct search this paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services and the potential use of systems of this type,
150,151.0,thesaurus compilation methods a literature review blagden  this review has been sponsored by the office for scientific and technical information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms parallel research in the business management area and also supported by osti is being conducted by david dews librarian of the manchester business school and k d c vernon librarian of the london graduate school of business studies as mr vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus a study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made so a decision to adopt some form of post co ordinate indexing was assumed thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted a decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary i e a thesaurus was eventually going to be developed despite the latest cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies this was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one which is certainly not the case with the rather soft language of management this is borne out to some extent by halkin who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry 55 percent engineering 35 percent and social science 20 per cent machine methods of term generation as described by ovchinnikov mastermann and luhn will not be considered as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest,
151,152.0,organizational aspects of information flow in technology allen  for about five years now a small group of us at mit have been conducting a series of investigations into the information needs of technologists the manner in which these needs are presently met the relation between various ways of fulfilling information needs and technological performance and the nature of factors which determine the ways in which information needs will be fulfilled,
152,153.0,criteria for evaluating technical library effectiveness wessel  in july 1966 john i thompson company accepted a contract with the picatinny arsenal us department of the army to perform a study aimed at developing criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library operations and services under the atlis program army technical library improvement studies the study was divided into three phases aimed at i a literature search to reflect the current state of the art covering library standards and the methods of evaluating libraries developed up to the present ii a phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from army technical libraries from available surveys already published or from any other sources by which to develop criteria iii a phase in which to establish and validate the criteria phases i and ii of the study are now complete phase iii is in progress and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968 the reports of phases i and ii are already available for detailed study and that of phase iii will be available soon the purpose of this paper is to present some of the findings of the study,
153,154.0,the udc in its international aspects lloyd  universal decimal classification dying duck or live bird or some such title was suggested to me but this is highly debatable and there will hardly be time for the duck shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the half hour or so allowed us for discussion besides i hope to be able to convince you if the bsi s fine efforts have not already done so that the udc is by no means the dying duck certainly not the dead duck that some of its severest critics seem to imagine perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of otlet la fontaine bradford and donker duyvis but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent fid inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of udc editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world,
154,155.0,subject relations in science technology literature earle  vickery  the analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use of the literature of science and technology citation is only an indicator of use not an accurate measure and like all such indicators has defects differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere despite these defects an examination of citations does enable one to sample acts of literature use within a large community the study reported here was directed in fact to all united kingdom authors of science technology publications in a given year and because of its width and the type of analysis performed is considered to be worth reporting the study was primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science literature and this has been reported elsewhere,
155,156.0,letter to the editor assessment of information services davison  may we please raise four questions which are important at the present time when government policy on information retrieval is being considered these arise from results recently produced by sdc which are germane to dr somerfield s paper on computer based information services aslib proceedings 20 12 542 50 1968 and to osti s work in this field the sdc is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study on the subject of computers related to mass spectrometry this results from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating results of searches in twelve of the world s major indexes to chemistry and spectroscopy including searches of sdc s own data bank files nearly two hundred unique references on computers related to mass spectrometry were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary,
156,157.0,on the design of information systems for human beings line  planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which has to be solved for example an increasing number of people may have to be housed in the same area or by a long term idealistic vision or by both the idealist seeing the long term implications of an immediate problem in short term planning the danger exists that the more technical problems may be solved without attention to their implications for human beings to take my housing example higher and higher flats may be built without considering the possible effects e g the effect on social groupings in long term planning utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced,
157,158.0,standard costing for information systems background to a current study robertson  reynolds  wilkin  for some time past interest has been developing within the aslib research department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information systems a literature search recently conducted by the department r reynolds has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them it would seem therefore that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems one might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems namely a general survey method the overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories and analysed for correlation see for example c j wessel et al b in depth study a small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them in a current project we are attempting to apply method b to the production of current awareness bulletins an outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows,
158,159.0,an information retrieval language for marc austin  i see from the programme that i am supposed to talk on an information language for marc and it is true that the work i have been doing for the past year or so has been under the auspices of the marc project but the subject indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with bnb s plans for computer production from 1971 as with the marc tapes as such and i hope to show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible general system with even wider application before coming to this however it is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which caused bnb to look to the computer for help from this we can see how the computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing,
159,160.0,analysis and organization of knowledge for retrieval farradane  in a university the mode of research is usually what is called pure or basic research since i am keeping in mind primarily the applications of information science i will prefer the word basic although there is not so much difference in such research and really in any good research one should not be collecting data haphazardly one must isolate and define a problem and as far as possible control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions it is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis the important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible if the answer disproves the hypothesis one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis if it confirms the hypothesis one is ready for a further step forward and so on research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods but this does not alter the general methodology on the whole i find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today,
160,161.0,user studies a review of the literature from 1966 to 1970 wood  my terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were to bring fishenden s work up to date this was published in the journal of documentation in september 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number of british use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the development of a national information service the present paper which covers the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed it considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists engineers social scientists and others and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop policies regarding library and information services at all levels although an increasing number of studies is being carried out in eastern europe and in the ussr there has been no major work reported and consequently the review considers mainly british and american investigations,
161,162.0,library and information science abstracts the first two years gilcrist  presanis  with the thirteenth issue affected by the recent postal strike now seems an opportune moment to take a look at the performance of lisa in its first two years this bi monthly abstracts service succeeded the former library science abstracts in 1969 as a joint venture between the library association and aslib a recount of its birth and a brief report on early progress both appeared in 1969,
162,163.0,the information uses and needs of social scientists an overview of infross line  when infross began in the autumn of 1967 although a large number of studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information very little had been done in the field of social science information there are a number of possible reasons for this social scientists faced with a much smaller total volume of information were much less information conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions there are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems finally until osti came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research this almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages there were very few clues to guide us and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark on the other hand we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non comparable studies there is something to be said for being one of the first in a field,
163,164.0,sdi some economic and organizational aspects dammers  in the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that i should deal specifically with the economic aspects of selective dissemination of information sdi operation and use in my opinion the technical feasibility and merits of sdi have been adequately demonstrated the main barriers hindering general use however tend to be of an economic nature at shell research in sittingbourne we have been operating since 1967 an sdi service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly particularly since we started to use the ca condensates tapes early in 1969 in addition to these tapes we are currently using the ba previews tapes agdoc tapes prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from derwent and on an experimental basis toxitapes produced by biosis philadelphia all these tapes are searched locally involving the running of around five hundred profiles weekly,
164,165.0,the theoretical foundation of the idc system six postulates for information retrieval fugmann  successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable by the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and conceptual respect steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of an inquirer if the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements its working capability will continuously decrease because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time search patience and search memory the degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates the better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system the higher are its working capability and life expectancy but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher the establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the idc system and its precursors these postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development,
165,166.0,the future of scientific and technological publications smailes  i am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific information that is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next two decades in 1967 olaf helmer then senior mathematician at the rand corporation forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from five million in 1967 to twenty five million by the year 2000 and their total productivity would go up by a factor of ten he declined to assess the associated growth of and need for scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted it is these substantial changes that concern the publisher editor information scientist and librarian because if we do not anticipate or at least keep pace with these changes then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information i regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity not as an act of desperation the big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and in this world of rapid change select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information,
166,167.0,rationalization of serial holdings in special libraries prosser  this paper describes progress which has been made toward the development of a procedural model intended as a code of good practice to enable special librarians to effect economies in their journal holdings by systematically planned use of the bll a theoretical model suggested by b c brookes was tested on various sets of usage data from seven special libraries but the results proved to be unrealistic in terms of immediate provision to the user a new experimental approach has now been developed based on the total use versus total cost of a journal collection,
167,168.0,aspects of the theory of syntax chomsky  the idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel well over a century ago it was expressed with reasonable clarity by wilhelm von humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics humboldt 1836 his view that a language makes infinite use of finite means and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is furthermore a outgrowth of a persistent concern within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind with this creative aspect of language use for discussion see chomsky 1964 forthcoming what is more it seems that even panini s grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a generative grammar in essentially the contemporary sense of this term this monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion what is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated this study deals then with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar for some definite answers will be proposed but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions,
168,169.0,the assault on privacy miller  the genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call i received during the fall of 1966 from dr james g miller then director of the university of michigan s mental health institute and currently vice president for academic affairs of cleveland state university he asked what i am sure he thought was a relatively straightforward and easily answered question what are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials on closer inquiry i discovered that dr miller was exploring the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national multi media information network that would electronically integrate our colleges and universities eventually providing each of them a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and educational services he subsequently sought to breathe life into this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the interuniversity communications council educom,
169,170.0,an assessment of quality in graduate education cartter  before this study was begun in the spring of 1964 serious deliberation was given to the question of american council of education sponsorship of an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that comprise an important segment of the council s membership there was never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective way what necessarily goes on continually in any event though usually in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way our commission on plans and objectives for higher education and other leading educators consulted concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the council s aegis was a suitable one,
170,171.0,the association of american library schools 1915 1968 an analytical history davis  the growth of professions has been one of the sociological phenomena of the past century as the strength of national professional associations of practitioners has increased concern with education for the professions has prompted schools to develop standards and curricula to support the preparation of practitioners during the half century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed national associations the association of american medical colleges for example was established in 1876 other professional school associations followed engineering 1893 law 1900 librarianship 1915 theology 1918 and social work 1919 these associations to cite a few have developed in different ways while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels of influence in affecting professional education,
171,172.0,as we may think bush  as director of the office of scientific research and development dr vannevar bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading american scientists in the application of science to warfare in this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased he urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge for years inventions have extended man s physical powers rather than the powers of his mind trip hammers that multiply the fists microscopes that sharpen the eye and engines of destruction and detection are new results but not the end results of modern science now says dr bush instruments are at hand which if properly developed will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages the perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work like emerson s famous address of 1837 on the american scholar this paper by dr bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge the editor,
172,173.0,authoritarian personality adorno  this is a book about social discrimination but its purpose is not simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body of information the central theme of the work is a relatively new concept the rise of an anthropological species we call the authoritarian type of man in contrast to the bigot of the older style he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti rational beliefs he is at the same time enlightened and superstitious proud to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power and authority the character structure which comprises these conflicting trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and political thinkers this book approaches the problem with the means of socio psychological research,
173,174.0,automated language processing borko  the idea for automated language processing was suggested in 1964 at a time when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval were expanding at system development corporation many people in the company were directly interested in this area and an even larger group had interests that were tangentially related a quick and effective means of acquainting them with the state of the art was needed but no convenient compilation of relevant material was available it was agreed that a book on the theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire range of technical developments in this field the staff as a whole is concerned with most phases of the work this is attested by the fact that all but one of the chapter authors were connected with sdc either as employees or consultants the single exception is pendergraft for sdc has had no sustained project in machine translation sdc management was enthusiastic in its support of the new project,

175,176.0,automated keyword classification for information retrieval sparck jones  this book is primarily a research monograph in which the discussion of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole it is not a textbook and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice of topic or account for the use of certain concepts or to provide an elementary description of either for instance in chapter 1 it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information retrieval i have not considered the relation between this kind of retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set or that between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the use of descriptions with a syntactic structure for example equally in chapter 2 i have made use of recall precision ratios as a means of characterising retrieval performance without justification or argument but this does not mean that i am unaware of the difficulties of doing this or of the attention which has been devoted to and controversy which has raged round this subject it is simply that from the point of view of my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios,
176,177.0,automation in libraries kimber  my purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding of what automated systems can do in libraries today i have limited myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed library housekeeping the processes of book ordering and cataloguing periodicals accessioning and circulation control whose purpose is to make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring storing and disseminating knowledge and information these are the processes which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of service which a library can give to its readers i hope that the descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries,
177,178.0,the automation survey background and conclusions king  during the past decade the library of congress in common with many other research libraries has become increasingly aware of pressures and strains in many of its operations these areas of concern well known to librarians include mounting arrearages in cataloguing and other processing activities increasing complexity of manual inventory control files increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues reasonably current and accurate and increasing demands for a wide variety of services for a clientele whose needs for information have grown tremendously since world war ii and many of whom have only recently turned to large research libraries for help five years ago an internal committee of the library of congress was charged to study potential applications of electronic data processing equipment to library procedures subsequently representatives of three computer firms made brief studies of library operations which intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially by automation,

179,180.0,automated information retrieval systems irs belonogov  it is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to the transmission accumulation and search of information automation can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions in all of these cases the results supplied by automatic devices are analysed and decisions are taken usually by man thus the role of machine is to considerably extend man s capabilities rather than to completely replace man the automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information have come to be called information retrieval systems irs these systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing the physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment punched card computers microfilming equipment and electronic computers the latter playing the most prominent part,1973-01-01 00:00:00

197,198.0,choosing physiology journals brodman  for many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections the nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by gross and gross in 1927 this method consists essentially of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation thus in the field of chemistry the references in the journal of the american chemical society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals according to gross and gross the journals which are cited most frequently in the journal of the american chemical society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well rounded collection in chemistry although the gross and gross method has been in use for almost twenty years the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined these assumptions are 1 the value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature 2 the journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field 3 if more than one journal is used as a base all of them can be weighted equally,
198,199.0,statistical bibliography in the health sciences raisig  the sustained interest in documentation as a key to the retrieval of information in the literature of the sciences has obscured largely the potential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing information needs in the belief that a discussion of the latter may be of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists a review of investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation of statistics relating to books and periodicals it may be used in a variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes to demonstrate historical movements to determine the national or universal research use of books and journals and to ascertain in many local situations the general use of books and journals,

225,226.0,a behavioral approach to historical analysis berkhofer  to issue a clarion call for historians to adopt a behavioral approach to their subject may seem as up to date and exciting as last month s newspaper for it is the academic fashion today to argue the utility of social science theory in the writing of history books and articles issue forth from the presses in seeming profusion advocating and even occasionally demonstrating such an approach yet these many pages fail in three significant ways to accomplish the end they nominally espouse and which i urge,
226,227.0,a behavioral theory of the firm cyert  this book is about the business firm and the way it makes economic decisions we propose to make detailed observations of the procedures by which firms make decisions and to use these observations as a basis for a theory of decision making within business organizations our articles of faith are simple we believe that in order to understand contemporary economic decision making we need to supplement the study of market factors with an examination of the internal operation of the firm to study the effects of organizational structure and conventional practice on the development of goals the formation of expectations and the execution of choices,
227,228.0,a mathematical theory of communication shannon  the recent development of various methods of modulation such as pcm and ppm which exchange bandwidth for signal to noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication a basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of nyquist and hartley on this subject in the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors in particular the effect of noise in the channel and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point frequently the messages have meaning that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities these semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem the significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages the system must be designed to operate for each possible selection not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design,
228,229.0,a mathematical theory of communication shannon  in this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now to a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis as the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case there are however a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases we will not attempt in the continuous case to obtain our results with the greatest generality or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis a preliminary study however indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others the occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest,

233,234.0,book availability and the library user buckland  the essentially logistical problem of making library books physically available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship this book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem as such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions no apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship the fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and thereby to improved library services,

256,257.0,classification for a general index language foskett  the role of classification schemes in libraries and information services has probably caused more argument than any other professional activity this would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly convenient way of arranging books on shelves some librarians think it is and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who like the classification research group actually spend years of their time in theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene on the one hand some librarians are criticizing the decimal classification especially as used in the british national bibliography for being too detailed and unwieldy on the other hand some librarians and still more information officers are busy revising the universal decimal classification in order to make it more detailed in the next field as it were computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding away at the ever growing masses of literature producing results that impress computer specialists but not information users who are so deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new,

307,308.0,the coming crisis of western sociology gouldner  the criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about society yet the gap between theory and practice so common in the history of american radical movements is in some quarters growing wider some of the most militant of american radicals in the new left or in the movement for black liberation have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory this neglect of theory doubtless has various origins in some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources the new radicalisms will in short need time to produce their new theories although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to americans it is in part also due to the fact that american radicals are often more american than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory again part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the hippie contingent of their generation whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting american culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile hassles of intellectual confrontation there is also a vocal minority who as has been said feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason,

312,313.0,communication among scientists and engineers nelson  in the course of collecting data on nine scientific and technological disciplines it has become obvious to us that in their communication activities some disciplines behave quite differently from others recently we have reanalyzed our data for the physical the engineering and the social sciences we do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences we have included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs however so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups before discussing these differences we should like to emphasize that there are similarities that there are of major importance and that they in fact make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible we will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science,
313,314.0,citation measures of hard science soft science technology and nonscience price  perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics my reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic conference is that i know well as an historian of science that the greatest and most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society but rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised i suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to solving practical problems for which they are designed it seems clear however that it is only such new understanding that can bring success whatever solutions ultimately emerge,

318,319.0,inefficiency of the use of boolean functions for information retrieval systems verhoeff  goffman  belzer  in this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are in general not applicable in information retrieval systems first we wish to stress that a system which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it this situation is of course well known saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances that is there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system s output is satisfactory however these should be relatively few in the case of an information retrieval system let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question so if we have a set of documents s and a set of questions q the system has to assign to each question q an answer a q which is a subset of s naturally this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question more precisely stated we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set,
319,320.0,the teachable language comprehender a simulation program and theory of language quillian  the teachable language comprehender tlc is a program designed to be capable of being taught to comprehend english text when text which the program has not seen before is input to it it comprehends that text by correctly relating each explicit or implicit assertion of the new text to a large memory this memory is a semantic network representing factual assertions about the world the program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text by this means the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory in this form it can be added into the memory both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory s prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed tlc presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities but within the system notations for expressing either of these are provided thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind the memory structure and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically that is once such an assertion or capability is put into the system it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future,
320,321.0,an information theoretic approach to text searching in direct access systems barton  creasey  lynch  snell  using direct access computer files of bibliographic information an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with information retrieval namely the maintenance and use of large dictionaries the greater part of which is used only infrequently a novel method is presented which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution this is more suited to implementation on storage devices this method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types the members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval the rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages k text searching information theory filed organization direct access information retrieval character string bit vector c 3 42 3 70 3 73 3 74 5 6,

325,326.0,computer filing of index bibliographic and catalog entries hines  the need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement has become increasingly apparent as more and more book catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically many of the difficulties in manual filing as shown in the a l a rules for filing catalog cards become even more intricate to cope with when computers are used of course if cost is not an object the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are practically limitless however modifications in rules and procedures can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index catalog or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible and these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer filing of complex alphabetic entries,
326,327.0,computer handling of chemical structure information lynch  far reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science are at present in motion which seem likely to have fundamental effects on scientists s use of and access to existing knowledge these changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear information handling is rapidly changing from a labour intensive industry to a capital intensive one as soaring man power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness accuracy and improved access but the changes to be effected also have major social implications the reasons for publication and use of information are complex reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood the rate at which innovations in information handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer but also by the sensitivity on the part of the designers and operators of information systems to the needs and habits of users and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods,

334,335.0,conceptual basis of the classification of knowledge wojciechowski  as far as philosophers are concerned the conference seems to be justified precisely because of the present state of the classification of knowledge for two thousand years the classification of knowledge has been a major philosophical problem lately it has evolved from a philosophical preoccupation into a specialized technique a species of the general techniques of classification far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally ignored by philosophers at the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge what is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification the need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge it is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest,
335,336.0,conceptual design of an automated national library system meise  this work describes a conceptual design of an automated national library system the design is conceptual in that it is intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than provide a detailed engineering design the design concerns an automated national library system but does not attempt to automate all parts of the system it is primarily concerned with the functions of bibliographic searching acquisition circulation and cataloging if these functions can be economically automated the major problems associated with our information explosion will be solved,

339,340.0,cooperation between types of libraries stenstrom  this bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its starting point public school academic research and special libraries this classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear distinction for the purposes of this work public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library s district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied for library purposes local public libraries systems of public libraries and state library agencies are included in this category school libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of schools whether they be public private or parochial school libraries at the elementary junior high school and senior high school level are included academic research libraries include the libraries of institutions of higher education both public and private as well as libraries which while they might be defined as either public or special are widely known for their research resources junior college libraries college libraries university libraries and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries the library of congress the newberry library and linda hall library are examples of nonacademic research libraries special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well defined information needs business and industrial libraries and the libraries of nonprofit organizations are common examples while distinctions between research and special libraries are not always easily made it is felt that in the case of this bibliography no serious problems are created,
340,341.0,copying methods manual hawken  the current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes methods techniques and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors 1 the great importance of document reproduction processes in the acquisition preservation dissemination and communication of information vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an international scale 2 the complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years the need for the coining of the new class word reprography an unfortunate graft of a latin fragment on a greek root is in itself indicative of the great changes that have come about processes and methods which formerly were discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated new processes and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities continue to appear this revolution in the document copying field has been powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for a share of the vast and lucrative office records copying field the results however have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of research materials as well,
341,342.0,corporate headings their use in library cataloguing and national bibliographics a comparative and critical study verona  this study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the main problems related to corporate headings the difficulties raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various countries in order to make the differences existing between the various solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of them more evident a great number of examples in a variety of languages extracted from cataloguing codes national bibliographies printed lists of corporate headings have been added these examples are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with regard to various technical details such as punctuation capitalization transliteration etc in addition many of these examples will clearly prove that certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of another country or another language in the study examination and analysis of codes has been complemented by references to professional literature on the subject available to the author and by an analysis of opinions expressed there special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing practices and citation usages and to investigations of the users approach to corporate headings it is well understood and appreciated that for the catalogue user the identification of and search for corporate headings present more problems than any other type of heading unfortunately however professional literature has as yet paid insufficient attention to these problems,
342,343.0,a criticism and the growth of knowledge kuhn  on almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems sir karl s view of science and my own are very nearly identical we are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research given that concern both of us emphasize as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life and both of us turn often to history to find them from this pool of shared data we draw many of the same conclusions both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory s occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic experiment or observation finally sir karl and i are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism s most characteristic theses we both emphasize for example the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects whatever the latter phrase may mean,
343,344.0,current problems in reference service galvin  current problems in reference service is a collection of thirty five new problem case studies intended for instructional use in both formal and informal teaching learning situations in the field of librarianship,
344,345.0,data bases computers and the social sciences bisco  this book was written with several diverse audiences in mind 1 social and behavioral scientists and their students 2 librarians and library science students who are favorable about employing computers and computer usable information in their work and classes and 3 archivists and their employees who desire to have more than a current overview of the problems and their tentative solutions because of the diversity of material it is not expected that all readers will use the book in the same way rather it is assumed that readers will supplement a subset of the book with bibliographical materials from the reference sections,
345,346.0,data study jolley  information whose handling is the topic of this book is generated by change and whatever is our unit of change is our unit of information in a situation in which only three possible moves can be made only three fundamental units of information can be found no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them our topic is therefore a special sort of change the change brought about in acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge,
346,347.0,cas computer based information services davenport  this paper describes the key points that characterize cas approach to large scale scientific technical information systems that must handle over 100 000 documents per year the first of these points is the single analysis multiple use concept intellectual ability is a rare commodity and essential to an information service therefore it makes sense to conserve that commodity and not use manpower to perform repetitive jobs or to waste effort analyzing information,
347,348.0,a regional network ohio college library center kilgour  the ohio college library center is developing a computerized user oriented library system that will improve efficiency of library use and operations that will increase availability of library resources within a region and that will facilitate evolution of new and easier accesses to information in libraries the center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past for the immediate future the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout ohio a more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions the passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries and will be increasingly inadequate in the future the per student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit cost rises in the general economy therefore the principal economic goal of the ohio college library center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per student costs so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole,
348,349.0,decision analysis introductory lectures on choices under uncertainty raiffa  these lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior neither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent fictitious being nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an idealized rational and economic man a man who always acts in a perfectly consistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherent set of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities rather the approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences he must consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate their implications for action such an approach is designed to help us reason and act a bit more systematically when we choose to do so,
349,350.0,the design of inquiring systems churchman  design is used throughout in its most generic sense to include planning operations research engineering design architectural design programming budgeting and all the other activities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and our environment to improve the quality of our lives so the book could be read as a philosophy of organization theory or of architectural or engineering design or of operations research or of planning the word inquiry suggests that the audience includes persons interested in the philosophy of science this is true so long as the interest is a very broad one concerned with the meaning of science with respect to other social institutions health education morality and so on inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science i could have called the book the design of systems but this would not adequately reflect my style which is to proceed from the more specific problem of inquiry to the whole system,
350,351.0,deterioration and preservation of library materials winger  the deterioration of library materials constant since libraries began has accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969 researchers have predicted that all paper based records of this century as well as those of earlier years face imminent ruin without new and effective efforts for their preservation most will not be usable in their present form in the next century the danger of destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world of knowledge and scholarship that they support for not only paper is involved similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products such as film which may substitute for paper as the material base of records and not only research libraries are involved the surprisingly rapid deterioration of printed materials even those that have been produced with some eye to permanence creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well,
351,352.0,developing multi media libraries hicks  this book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensive resource center the philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook or audiovisual materials interchangeably defined as those materials that communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli are recommended along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks their organization in general in discussed with emphasis on the necessity for basic decisions and policies cataloging and physical processing are treated in particular demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific clientele realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately many easy to follow cataloging examples are presented and consistent with established library routine practical information is provided on selection acquisition physical processing storage and equipment work flow charts are included to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures,
352,353.0,the development of reference services through academic traditions public library practice and special librarianship rothstein  modern american library history has received only sporadic attention as a subject for investigation though we have now accumulated an adequate supply of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports service studies biographical accounts and chronicles of individual libraries no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of american librarianship to paraphrase leo lamontagne we have salvaged remnants from the past but we have yet to convert them into history the lack has cost the profession dearly even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts there is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of american library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of american librarianship the present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end it undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing problems of american librarianship the provision of reference services in research libraries,
353,354.0,dewey decimal classification dewey  the schedules of edition 18 like those of 17 are based on the principle of subject integrity both the subject matter and the notation are hierarchical so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts the schedules are developed according to logical principles so that the classifier is guided to make correct decisions the terminology of the classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature being classified for ease of use this edition includes many more example notes more detailed and precise instructions and freer use of layman s terminology than did its immediate predecessor since this edition is intended for use as a shelf arrangement system for general libraries of all sizes its fulness is based upon the number of titles that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields since it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies for which the dewey decimal classification is increasingly in demand in many countries it contains an increased number of provisions for number building,
354,355.0,diffusion of abstract and indexing services for government sponsored research klempner  during the last several decades science and technology have undergone a drastic transformation the enormity and depth of this transformation can be measured in many ways it can be measured in terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate and undergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and applied sciences in terms of the number of new devices products and innovations introduced into the military establishment and into the civilian sector of our economy in terms of the number of scientists and engineers employed by industry and public and private institutions in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on research and development in terms of the number of technical reports books journals papers reprints and conference proceedings stemming from these expenditures and in many other ways,
355,356.0,diffusion of innovations rogers  this book is directed both to advanced college students enrolled in sociology courses and to students of the other social sciences such as anthropology economics history and psychology who are concerned with diffusion for this reason sociological concepts are defined when they are introduced more than five hundred publications on the diffusion of innovations are reviewed here the innovations studied range from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive tribes and from driver training among public high schools to hybrid corn among farmers although a generally consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies a search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas this volume synthesizes these findings and theories,
356,357.0,directory of data base in the social and behavioral sciences sessions  as one of the early members of the computer community i have been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies in the social and behavioral sciences and their encouragement by the data processing environment the economists with an already established mathematical orientation were among the earliest beneficiaries of the machine technology that enhances their ability to construct the test models of economic behavior today statistical methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for one foreign language similarly the ability to program in an appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as french or german in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at the city university of new york and at other universities the chief function of this directory in terms of academic supplies of data is not to reinventory the social science data archives that are well known to the academic community not to duplicate the announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their members the reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those researchers either in or out of the university who are not sufficiently aware of these important resources,
357,358.0,the disadvantaged and library effectiveness lipsman  the report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective programs in the absence of established standards or criteria for measuring program effectiveness we have substituted a comparative analysis of a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process a survey of needs and interests of the target groups both users and nonusers and an assessment of the library s role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other community institutions serving the same groups thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move to achieve the study objectives library programs and practices in low income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities in each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas 1 the needs and interests of the community residents 2 library services in relation to other available community resources 3 the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system and 4 available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program,
358,359.0,documentation bradford  more than half a century ago la fontaine and otlet started their lives work which at first was connected with the term bibliography but to which gradually the work documentation was attributed what they developed was of a far wider scope than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed and non printed documents the great deal which inspired them and those who worked side by side with them was to render accessible the totality of what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a common treasure of mankind serving to bring mutual comprehension and to build for peace by the co operation of all men of goodwill of all nations it was in this spirit that my friend bradford joined those men whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives and it was in this spirit that bradford thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences such a compilation would indeed be welcome because curiously enough up to now there is no good general treatise on documentation available but his book gives us before all things an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts,1948-01-01 00:00:00

360,361.0,documentation bradford  since the first publication of this work dr bradford has died and a further edition now being called for an attempt has been made to recognize if not to deal with some criticisms expressed on the first edition the principal one was that whereas the book was entitled documentation it dealt in the main with the universal decimal classification which bradford did much to develop but that it neglected other aspects and instruments of the subject of which the udc is only one even if an important one of various techniques,1953-01-01 00:00:00

362,363.0,dynamic information and library processing salton  among the various information processing tasks which may be carried out with computing equipment a special class exists for which the term information takes on the literal and direct sense of recorded knowledge or intelligence the elements being transformed are then no longer restricted to mathematical symbols alone but they may be words and phrases books documents pictures and other information carriers it is that more restricted interpretation of an information process which gives rise to the field of information science concerned with the collection analysis classification storage retrieval transmission and dissemination of recorded data and intelligence,
363,364.0,economic analysis of the public libraries newhouse  this study addresses itself to several questions important to all public libraries how should the library allocate its book budget what kinds of books should it tend to buy what types of households use the library why do some households not use the library what is the cost of the various services provided by the library what specific steps can the library take to improve its services what are the library s options in choosing among the different circulation systems for how long should the library allow books to be checked out how frequently should overdue notices be sent out is an investment in a security system worthwhile we have studied these questions in the context of one public library the beverly hills california public library and have developed a methodology for determining answers to them as well as to other questions that arose during our investigation although answers will vary from library to library our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public libraries,
364,365.0,economics of the academic libraries baumol  this volume represents what we believe to be as complete and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic data on college and university libraries in the course of our study we have examined the data for comprehensiveness and consistency we have investigated their intertemporal behavior both as a basis for projection and as an instrument for long range planning and we have constructed a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most critical economic variables relating to library operations in particular in the course of this last step we have provided relationships explaining statistically the determination of such variables as the size of libraries budgets and the magnitude of their professional staffs,
365,366.0,economics of approval plans spyersduran  current budget strains on college and university libraries require a stepped up search for operating economies the timely topic of economics of approval plans of the third international conference on approval and gathering plans for large and medium size academic libraries held at the ramada inn west palm beach florida february 17 19 1971 has thus generated considerable interest the papers published here constitute by and large original research in this area the importance of these contributions can hardly be overestimated since they will no doubt mold and influence collection development practices in the current imprint area,
366,367.0,economics of book storage ellsworth  this report attempts to present and interpret current winter 1968 69 information on the economics of book storage in relation to the other factors a university administrator must consider in developing a program for housing an ever growing book collection when there are present or future limitations on space and money the study will attempt to answer two specific questions 1 is it economical for colleges and universities to select so called little used books from the regular bookstacks and store them elsewhere 2 is the cost factor the only one a university need consider in adopting a storage program and if not how is cost related to the others the facts and conclusions in this report are based on the library book storage situation as of 1969 innovations in computer applications and other technologies could presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors but it is the author s opinion that these changes unlikely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years,
367,368.0,economies and computers sharpe  it is not a simple matter to describe this book briefly it attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision makers in the selection financing and or use of computers only theory relevant for such decision makers is presented here this means that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside the scope of this book as do a number of related issues we deal thus with microeconomic not macroeconomic theory our focus is on the small industry firm computer and not the large gross national product consumer price index unemployment,
368,369.0,economics of defense in the nuclear age hitch  the purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions essentially we regard all military problems as in one of their aspects economic problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources we believe that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are responsible for defense and the officials and congressmen whose primary interest is economy except in determining the over all size of the military budget where conflict between these points of view is inevitable,

370,371.0,education and training for scientific and technological library and information work schur  the exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years it is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming in science information this point has now been reached to take but one field chemistry it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published and over 30 years from 1907 to 1938 for the first million to be abstracted in chemical abstracts we are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five year period 1962 1967 and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers equal to the output of the whole pre war generation of chemists will be published and abstracted in a single year the first scientific serial began publication in 1665 some 290 years later in 1956 the science museum library was receiving 9 000 current scientific serials within only a further 11 years the national lending library for science and technology n l l was receiving over three times this number the growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular thus for example in 1930 the number of loans by the science museum library was 10 000 in 1967 the n l l which had taken over the national lending function of the science museum library lent well over half a million items a total exceeding that of all the loans by the science museum library between 1929 and 1947 a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses enormous progress in antibiotics developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology there are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples may not be maintained but any flattening out that may develop will be at a very high level indeed,

372,373.0,some user requirements stated quantitatively in terms of the 90 percent library bourne  librarians publishers and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user s specific requirements for information such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems to date most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact relatively little objective data have been obtained this is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner this paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner this paper also furnishes several examples of such statements and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements in this paper attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields however it seems quite likely that the approach and perhaps even the stated principles could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge,

379,380.0,error correcting codes peterson  several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergence of the field of error correcting codes over the past two decades externally the cost of solid state electronic devices has decreased almost as dramatically as their size this has stimulated the development of digital computers and peripheral devices and this in turn has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of data communicated between such machines the intolerance of computing systems to error and in some cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either error free facilities or some type of error detecting or correcting code in the terminal devices in many cases the latter approach is the more economical,
380,381.0,the evaluation of information services and products king  the continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of others coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published material during the past several decades has placed new emphasis on the old arts of assembling coding and disseminating recorded knowledge in some instances the emphasis has manifested itself in research on improvement of traditional library systems in other instances it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways still other systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to requests to the active role of supplying documents or references to them to researchers as the documents become available for lack of a more descriptive terminology all of these activities are referred to in this book as document transfer systems implying that the product being retrieved or disseminated is a document rather than the information if any in it that is intelligence systems or fact retrieval systems if facts are indeed retrieved are excluded from our concern the document of course may be a book a journal article a drawing an abstract a piece of film or a piece of magnetic tape,

384,385.0,evaluative research principles and practice in public service and social action programs suchman  in these days of large government programs intended to reduce poverty develop communities prevent delinquency and crime control disease and reconstruct cities the predominant rhetoric is that of planning pilot projects experimental and demonstration programs and evaluation those who seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submitted to funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion in the proposal of a final section on evaluation in most cases this section consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action in some cases there is an elegant highly academic and impractical scheme worked out in meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant in a few treasured instances there is a well considered realistic and workmanlike plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked and why,
385,386.0,informal communication in science its advantages and its formal analogues menzel  formal and informal scientific communication are complementary they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that perhaps certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed word the library and the mechanized search and retrieval system whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word of mouth and the telephone the much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication for any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results,
386,387.0,the foundations of education for librarianship shera  the study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and administration first at the university of chicago and subsequently at western reserve university now case western reserve university and which has been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed my purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education therefore the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological neurological and psychological structure and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics the study then progresses to an exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society together with the place of the library in it,
387,388.0,a guide to the construction and use of special schemes vickery  the use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is appreciated for documentation and information retrieval in general other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available that classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is however made evident in two ways first to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques second there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge it is to help meet these demands particularly the second that this guide has been prepared the techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional tree of knowledge schemes can now be designed these developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology there is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification,
388,389.0,factors determining the performance of indexing systems cleverdon  the original aslib cranfield investigations on the efficiency of indexing systems references 1 2 and 3 did not by itself produce firm answers to what is one of the basic problems in information retrieval namely the decision as to which index language should be used certainly it did not as some people had anticipated demonstrate that one system was better than another either generally or in any given situation,
389,390.0,factors determining the performance of indexing systems cleverdon  the test results are presented for a number of different index languages using various devices which affect recall or precision within the environment of this test it is shown that the best performance was obtained with the group of eight index languages which used single terms the group of fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance while a group of six index languages based on the thesaurus of engineering terms of the engineers joint council were intermediary of the single term index languages the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance the use of precision devices such as links gave no advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination,
390,391.0,factors in the transfer of technology gruber  the strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country s research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of 200 million some thirty years ago to 17 billion today the research budgets of the private sector of the economy which were almost miniscule in the 1930 s total approximately 8 billion today these expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application for the most part is still a potential one the sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way or the economical way or the safe way or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy the value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability as a national resource for underwriting further economic and industrial development this technical inventory is a factor of major importance,
391,392.0,faculty status for librarians massman  the purpose of this study is 1 to review the history of the struggle for faculty status for librarians and some of the arguments advanced in support of that objective and 2 to gather information on the similarities and differences between librarians and faculty members in the broad areas of preparation contributions and rewards with detailed information on such matters as education salaries professional experience tenure sabbaticals participation in academic government and scholarly activity of librarians and faculty members one should be able to judge whether librarians receive unfair or unequal treatment,
392,393.0,farewell to alexandria solution to space growth and performance problems of libraries gore  the publication of this collection of essays opens a new era for libraries taking the first departure in 2 300 years from that durable model conceived by the librarians of alexandria and endlessly replicated by every succeeding generation of librarians right down to the present day the alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faith that to be good a library must be vast and always growing the papers presented here examine that faith scientifically demonstrate that it rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition and consign it to the limbo of outworn dogmas,
393,394.0,a feasibility study of centralized and regionalized inter library loan centers stevens  the two major problems of the present system are 1 the unequal distribution of lending with a few of the largest libraries handling a large proportion of the requests and 2 the difficulty of filling requests which are incomplete incorrect or inadequately checked solutions proposed for these two problems have been 1 compensation to the largest libraries for each transaction and 2 better bibliographic checking of requests before they are forwarded to the lending library,

395,396.0,formal languages salomaa  this book develops a theory of formal languages from the point of view of generative devices mainly grammars recognition devices automata are introduced only as a secondary tool and are themselves presented within the framework of rewriting systems the main emphasis is on mathematical aspects of formal languages rather than application people interested only in applications to programming languages resp natural languages would certainly prefer a more comprehensive discussion on topics such as lr k grammars resp transformational grammars such discussions lie outside the scope of this book,
396,397.0,formal languages and their relation to automata hopcroft  this book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship to automata the book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language the fundamental descriptive device the grammar is explained as well as its three major subclasses regular context free and context sensitive grammars the context free grammars are treated in detail and such topics as normal forms derivation trees and ambiguity are covered four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described these automata are the finite automaton the pushdown automaton the linear bounded automaton and the turing machine the turing machine is covered in detail and unsolvability of the halting problem shown the book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory closure properties computational complexity deterministic pushdown automata lr k grammars stack automata and decidability,
397,398.0,informal channels of communication in the behavioral sciences their relevance in the structuring of formal or bibliographic communication garvey  griffith  what are the needs being served by informal communication what can be done about giving informal communication without destroying its function for the active researcher certain of the advantages of formal communication such as general accessibility permanence etc how can formal channels be manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal communication to cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology considers the special advantages of informal communication and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels in a final section of the paper two experiments in scientific communication are described one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to informalize formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that in general attempts to formalize an informal channel,
398,399.0,functional approach sgall  the present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic linguistics being pursued at charles university prague it is based mainly on p sgall s book 1967a in czech which represents the first attempt at a systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has gradually been elaborated by our research group we do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation see section 1 3 4 may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics this conception originated in 1963 1964 mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description it has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book we do not present a complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart to the new version of transformational grammar we have simply tried to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the development of a new alternative,

407,408.0,handbook of data processing for libraries hayes  the purpose of this book therefore is to assist libraries and librarians in resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology the intent is to provide a concrete factual guide to the principles and methods available for the application of modern data processing to library operations for the operating librarian it should be considered a handbook a tool to guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques into his own library for the student it should be a textbook educating him not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data processing and the library for the system designer it should be a summary of the state of the art serving as a bridge between library objectives and the technology the book throughout lays special stress on the library and particularly on the significance of library values and policies for determining the choice of system the book gives emphasis to the computer but always in the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems as an addition to resources for information service as a tool of good management and not as an end in itself at most therefore the book aims to educate the profession in the use of these tools and in the special problems of applying them to libraries in this respect much of the groundwork has already been done the profession has been educating itself has carried out analyses of library operations has experimented with mechanization and is developing better concepts of cost control the book merely continues a process that is already underway,1970-01-01 00:00:00
408,409.0,hdb of data processing for libraries hayes  the four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries where one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate each kind of application now there are five to ten where the cadre of knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small now virtually every major library has some kind of systems department where the efforts at that time were largely experimental and developmental now there is a wealth this second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different from that of the first but its aims are the same to ensure that practicing librarians and that students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library s processing problems the changes from the first edition therefore represent not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content to reflect the advances and experience gained and an opportunity to correct the errors hopefully minor that have been found through use of the first edition,
409,410.0,handbook of medical library practice annan  the medical library association has long been aware of the need for a third edition of the handbook changes in library practices proliferating demands upon established libraries and the development of new ones created the need of an up to date tool like the earlier editions this handbook is such a tool a manual not a survey of the state of the art it offers practical advice to all fledgling librarians starting their careers experienced librarians transferring to the field of health sciences established medical librarians refreshing memories or adopting procedures unfamiliar to them and specialists in related fields,

411,412.0,the hidden dimension hall  generally speaking there are two types of books of interest to the serious reader today those that are content oriented designed to convey a particular body of knowledge and those that deal with structure the way in which events are organized it is doubtful if an author has any control over which of these two types of books he writes though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference the same applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his unstated expectations in today s world when all of us are overwhelmed with data from many sources it is easy to understand why people are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in their own field one senses that there is also a growing awareness of a loss of relatedness to the world at large this loss of relatedness leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man must cope the hidden dimension attempts to provide just this,
412,413.0,historical introduction to library school white  this is a revision and enlargement of origins of the american library school someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the past and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to be what it is this study is less a descriptive history of library schools and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems as well as the course pursued in resolving them can be more fully understood the original study begun in 1941 42 sought to throw light on how library education at that time came to be what is was the present study continues beyond the early forming of the american library school to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization a new title is used to reflect the broadened scope,

415,416.0,human behavior and the principles of least effort an introduction to human ecology zipf  nearly twenty five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe and if we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont to study say the social behavior of bees or the nestbuilding habits of birds the present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that ensued in the course of those years and which led to the disclosure of some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our behavior both as individuals and as members of social groups,
416,417.0,human problem solving newell  simon  the present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adults in our own culture the tasks discussed are short half hour moderately difficult problems of a symbolic nature the three main tasks we use chess symbolic logic and algebra like puzzles called cryptarithmetic puzzles typify this class of problems the study is concerned with the integrated activities that constitute problem solving it is not centrally concerned with perception motor skill or what are called personality variables the study is concerned primarily with performance only a little with learning and not at all with development or differences related to age finally it is concerned with integrated activities hence deemphasizes the details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions that is half a second or less similarly long term integrated activities extending over periods of days or years receive no attention,
417,418.0,the human side of enterprise mcgregor  this volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the human side of enterprise is all of a piece that the theoretical assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources determine the whole character of the enterprise they determine also the quality of its successive generations of management of course the process is circular and herein lies the possibility and the hope of future progress the key question for top management is what are your assumptions implicit as well as explicit about the most effective way to manage people from the answer to this question flow the answers to the questions mr sloan raised in our discussion about the making of managers as well as answers to many other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise it will be clear to the reader that i believe many of our present assumptions about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate,
418,419.0,a statistical approach to mechanized encoding and searching of literary information luhn  written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed of different levels of specificity and by means of different words the problem of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties a statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest the establishment of a set of notions and the vocabulary by which they are expressed the compilation of a thesaurus type dictionary and index the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary the encoding of topological notations such as branches structures the recording of the coded information the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search,
419,420.0,the automatic creation of literature abstracts luhn  experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of conventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means in the exploratory research described the complete text of an article in machine readable form is scanned by an ibm 704 data processing machine and analyzed in accordance with a standard program statistical information derived from word frequency and distribution is used by the machine to compute a relative measure of significance first for individual words and then for sentences sentences scoring highest in significance are extracted and printed out to become the auto abstract,
420,421.0,a business intelligence system luhn  an automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the various sections of any industrial scientific or government organization this intelligence system will utilize data processing machines for auto abstracting and auto encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the action points in an organization both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted characterized by a word pattern and sent automatically to appropriate action points this paper shows the flexibility of such a system in identifying known information in finding who needs to know it and in disseminating it efficiently either in abstract form or as a complete document,
421,422.0,on some clustering techniques bonner  the problem of organizing a large mass of data occurs frequently in research normally some process of generalization is used to compress the data so that it can be analyzed more easily a primitive step in this process is the clustering technique which involves gathering together similar data into a cluster to permit a significant generalization this paper describes a number of methods which make use of ibm 7090 computer programs to do clustering a medical research problem is used to illustrate and compare these methods,
422,423.0,r and d project selection where we stand baker  pound  a review of the literature on r and d project selection and an analysis of interview data suggest that there is a lack of testing and use of the methods proposed several or ms methods are identified and their current status is indicated three representative procedures are examined in some detail it is argued that both a lack of testing concerning feasibility and shortcomings of the models themselves help to explain why the methods have not been used some of these shortcomings are identified and discussed implications for future research are presented,
423,424.0,a method for allocating r d expenditures rosen  souder  the analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for r d investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting goals corporate goals may require the r d manager to simultaneously seek the highest probable profits the largest probable number of successes and the greatest probable profit per dollar spent departmental goals may restrict the manager to some maximum budget a minimum number of projects to be worked on and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects in a sense then the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple output production problem how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall this paper shows how a slight modification of hess approach to project selection and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple product factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve these project selection resource allocation and budget determination problems most approaches in the literature have treated these three problems separately,
424,425.0,the selection of r d program content survey of quantitative methods cetron  martino  roepcke  this paper presents a summary of methods of evaluating and selecting r d projects approximately thirty methods which have appeared is scattered places in the literature are described briefly and a bibliography is provided for further information the various methods are compared and contrasted with each other relative to a standard set of features which they may possess to a standard set of characteristics relating to ease of use and to scientific or technological area of applicability,
425,426.0,the effects of perceived need and means on the generation of ideas for industrial research and development projects baker  siegman  rubenstein  a flow model is presented which identifies some of the organizational factors influencing idea generation behavior in industrial r d laboratories the model is constructed from literature based propositions which make explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the model data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional laboratory of a major u s corporation in general these data support the a priori propositions further data analysis suggests that two pieces of information are required before an idea is generated 1 knowledge of a need problem or opportunity relevant to the company and 2 knowledge of a means or technique for satisfying the need solving the problem or capitalizing on the opportunity these results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative thought proposed by other investigators finally the organizational events which were associated as needs events or means events for the ideas studies are identified and analyzed with respect to both quantity and quality of ideas,
426,427.0,the validity of subjective probability of success forecasts by r d project managers souder  models and techniques to aid management in planning controlling r d projects frequently use subjective probability of success forecasts as one of the major inputs an experiment was conducted at the research laboratories of monsanto company to measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts the results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain types of r d projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape of polled probability of success forecasts probability of success forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than several commonly used project status measures these results tend to support the hypothesis that r d planning and control models that are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing projects as well as to aid in project selection and project funding,
427,428.0,analysis of some portfolio selection models for r d gear  lockett  pearson  this paper presents the analytical review of mathematical programming models that have been proposed as aids to the related problems of resources allocation and project selection in r d the models are classified according to whether they are based on linear integer chance constrained or dynamic programming representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in detail the evaluation is on terms of data requirements built in assumptions ease of computation usefulness of outputs versatility of application,
428,429.0,the information content of titles in engineering literature bottle  since many alerting and information services rely very heavily on the use of titles to transfer information to the potential user it is essential that he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore miss methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and type of information lost through scanning title listing only between one third and one half of indexable terms are not retrievable from article titles even if all possible synonyms and related terms are used if all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information retrieved is increased by about 70 percent the problems of dealing with synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are discussed the possibility of using keywords in journal titles as supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in nearly one third of the sample of papers analyzed,
429,430.0,on fuzzy mapping and control chang  zaden  a fuzzy mapping from x to y is a fuzzy set on x y the concept is extended to fuzzy mappings of fuzzy set on x to y fuzzy function and its inverse fuzzy parametric function fuzzy observation and control set theoretical relations are obtained for fuzzy mappings fuzzy functions and fuzzy parametric functions it is shown that under certain conditions a precise control goal can be attained with fuzzy observation and control as long as the observations become sufficiently precise when the goal is approached,

431,432.0,illustrative computer programming for libraries davis  illustrative computer programming is intended as a graded workbook or text supplement containing typical practical problems suggested solutions and tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency and some of the major features of pl i programming language one as such it can be used alone or in combination with established pl i textbooks such as those listed in the selected bibliography programmers with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered by excessive introductory material while beginners can learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems and their accompanying analyses,
432,433.0,improving access to library resources dougherty  the motivation for this investigation derived from a series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed to the design development and operation of non traditional automated information systems at the time of the visits the systems seemed to be working technically but paradoxically they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the respective user communities although few people associated with the systems openly expressed concern there were non verbal indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time and money a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate,
433,434.0,indexing languages and thesauri construction and maintenance soergel  this book has two objectives first to reassess thoroughly the functions of an indexing language or thesaurus in a information storage and retrieval system and in the light of this reassessment to analyze the structure of indexing languages and thesauri most importantly this reassessment is based on a unified view of indexing languages classification schemes and thesauri as information storage and retrieval systems on the other it results in general principles that are applicable to a wide range of situations,
434,435.0,industrial dynamics forrester  this book is intended for the student of management whether he is in a formal academic program or in business it treats the central framework underlying industrial activity the goal is enterprise design to create more successful management policies and organizational structures,
435,436.0,industrial research and technological innovation an econometric analysis mansfield  after many years of neglect technological change is receiving the attention from economists that it deserves the 1960 s being a time of a enormous interest in this area in academic government and business circles central to the economics of technological change is the manner in which new processes and products are conceived developed commercialized and accepted to help promote a better understanding of this process i have been engaged for a number of years in a series of related econometric studies of industrial research and technological innovation the purpose of this book is to bring together the results of these studies,
436,437.0,industry and technical progress carter  this book is written in the belief that the full and speedy application of science in industry is necessary to economic progress and should indeed be one of the most important objectives of national policy this being so it is important to identify the hindrances to speedy application many people have already drawn attention to particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report did not consider that there was any up to date assessment of the problem which attempted to look at it as a whole in all its variety and complexity hence the investigation which they undertook and largely entrusted to us an investigation which through the great goodwill of many people in british industry has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first impression and summary,
437,438.0,inequality a reassessment of the effect of family and schooling in america jenchs  this book summarizes the results of three years of research at the center for educational policy research the eight coauthors were all research associates at the center and our work there was a collaborative effort we plagiarized both ideas and data from one another most of us also spent a good deal of time criticizing one another s work while each of us took primary responsibility for certain lines of inquiry and this responsibility is recorded in appropriate footnotes we see our research as an integrated effort which should bear all our names,
438,439.0,research studies in patterns of scientific communication i general description of research program garvey  lin  nan  nelson  tomita  this article is the first in a series which described the general procedures and some findings of over seventy studies which we conducted from 1966 to 1971 on the information exchange activities of over 12000 scientists and engineers in a sample of nine physical social and engineering sciences we designed the studies so that a the full spectrum of scientific communication media could be explored b the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies c the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final integration into the general body of scientific knowledge and d the same studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that genuine comparisons could be made among them the data are now stored on machine readable magnetic tapes and will be made available to scholars in the field of information science,
439,440.0,research studies in scientific communication iv the continuity of dissemination of information by productive scientists garvey  lin  tomita  this article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which were conducted over a 4 5 year period 1966 1971 the series of articles sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published the present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information exchange by productive scientists two years after the publication of their articles in 1968 1969 the results indicate that about half of the authors had changed to a subject matter area which differed from that of their earlier articles however such shifts did not decrease authors productivity nor greatly increase their information needs,
440,441.0,inference and disputed authorship mosteller  we apply a 200 year old mathematical theorem to a 175 year old historical problem more to advance statistics than history though problems of disputed authorship are common in history literature and politics scholars regard their solutions as minor advances for us the question of whether hamilton or madison wrote the disputed federalist papers has served as a laboratory and demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods while we help solve this historical problem our practical application of bayes theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics furthermore large practical applications have until now been few and our work helps fill that gap,
441,442.0,storage analysis of a compression coding for document data bases heaps  analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression of terms within a document data base the storage efficiency is expressed in terms of the vocabulary length and the values of certain parameters which describe the structure of the code for vocabularies of up to 100 000 terms the average code length is approximately twelve bits no information is lost through term truncation or abbreviation the tables required for coding and decoding may be ordered for rapid access without reduction in the ease of update,
442,443.0,quantitative fuzzy semantics zaden  the point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language l as a fuzzy relation from a set of terms t x to a universe of discourse u y as a fuzzy relation l is characterized by its membership function ml t u 0 1 which associates with each ordered pair x y its grade of membership ml x y in l given a particular x in t the membership function ml x y defines a fuzzy set m x in u whose membership function is given by mm x y ml x y the fuzzy set m x is defined to be the meaning of the term x with x playing the role of a name for m x if a term x in t is a concatenation of other terms in t that is x x1 xn xi t i epsilon 1 n then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1 xn through the use of a lambda expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x the use of this approach is illustrated by examples,
443,444.0,on relevance as a measure coffman  relevance is defined as a measure of information conveyed by a document relative to a query it is shown that the relationship between the document and the query though necessary is not sufficient to determine relevance,
444,445.0,a definition of relevance for information retrieval cooper  the concept of relevance sometimes also called pertinence or aboutness is central to the theory of information retrieval unfortunately however there is at present no consensus as to how this notion should be defined the purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of what it means to say that a piece of stored information is relevant to the information need of a retrieval system user the suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical implication for one yes or no question answering system which operates with one of the standard formalized languages the definition provides a mathematically precise criterion of relevance for other types of fact retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems including all systems whose stored information is expressed in natural language the definition is not mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual level,
445,446.0,computer assisted indexing gray  the paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based information retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index terms to be assigned to a new document entering the system the method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the new article this produces a list of index terms weighted according to their expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article thus the indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an aid an evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial set of documents these documents have already been indexed for the medlars system the list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each document the results of this comparison are encouraging and they are discussed in the paper the economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information retrieval system is considered this included the expected benefits and an estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer time and indexer time,
446,447.0,a note on the concept of relevance foskett  two recent articles in this journal konigova 1 cooper 2 have gone beyond the usual slapdash use of the words relevant and relevance and have attempted to explicate the concept further both attempts only partially succeed konigova proposes three types formal relevance subject content relevance and subjective relevance or pertinency this classification has validity but is not further elaborated and indeed she reverts to a less precise language for example in defining second order noise she uses the ambiguous phrase a formally relevant document which is not really relevant presumably meaning not subjectively relevant according to the real need of the enquirer and in her mathematics as she admits no account is taken of the subjective relevance pertinence yet this is surely the true aim of the system,
447,448.0,an evaluation of query expansion by the addition of clustered terms for a document retrieval system minker  wilson  zimmerman  an evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be extracted from an automatically indexed document collection and the effects of employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described the graph theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data the clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved in some cases however significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system the data bases employed were relatively small and the authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other situations,
448,449.0,situational relevance wilson  the concept of situational relevance is introduced based on w s cooper s definitions of logical relevance on the notion of evidential relevance drawn from inductive logic on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set of personal concerns the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges of alternatives situationally relevant items of information are those that answer or logically help to answer questions of concern significant situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in relation to questions of concern it is claimed that situational relevance is an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance and that it is the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying practically relevant information,
449,450.0,selection of equifrequent word fragments for information retrieval schuegraf  heaps  the design of programs to research large document data bases is discussed with regard to the use of compression coding combined with adoption of word fragments as the basic language elements an algorithm is described for determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments its efficiency is tested for a sample data base formed from the marc tapes a certain threshold frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct fragments the selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base by concatenation of non overlapping fragments,
450,451.0,interaction between requesters and a large mechanized retrieval system lancaster  in a large mechanized retrieval system a certain proportion of the search failures are likely to be directly attributable to inadequate user system interaction request statements may be only distant approximations of actual information requirements this paper discusses some of the problems of the user system interface and suggests methods whereby these problems may be alleviated,

452,453.0,information in 1985 a forecasting study of information needs and resources anderla  the primary purpose of this study is to estimate the supply of and above all the demand for scientific and technical information its secondary objective is to make a long term assessment of qualitative and quantitative requirements for information specialists in both instances of course future technical developments as far as they can be foreseen must be taken into account at the same time like most work sponsored by the oecd its aim is to identify significant criteria for defining a policy in this case an information policy which is greatly needed in all oecd countries,
453,454.0,information analysis and retrieval kent  therefore the purpose of this book remains the same as that of textbook on mechanized information retrieval to teach basics to those who have had no previous exposure either to the field or to computers or both therefore the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of information retrieval systems are laid bare other books have been published that emphasize computer programming this one does not,
454,455.0,fuzzy sets zaden  a fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership such a set is characterized by a membership characteristic function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one the notions of inclusion union intersection complement relation convexity etc are extended to such sets and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established in particular a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint,
455,456.0,information and its user brittain  in science and technology user studies are numerous and have a history of some twenty years the relevance of the methodology of science user studies to the social sciences is considered in chapter 2 the pressing need in user studies in science as well as social science is for a general body of theory about the flow of information in research and teaching communities some of the fundamental characteristics of social science research and its literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information needs and requirements are considered in the first part of chapter 3 and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies in the social sciences other relevant material about the use made of information is discussed in chapter 4 on systematic approaches,
456,457.0,information mechanism and meaning mackay  in a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to keep abreast of new and non redundant literature the publication of collected papers like the estate of holy matrimony is something not to be undertaken unadvisedly lightly or wantonly in the present case it would not have been considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected friend professor roman jakobson whose persistent encouragement alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel for our ten to twenty year old productions and brought this first volume to the point of no return it is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up on the other hand as most of them were written for specific occasions each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem with occasional exceptions redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers the solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters where some comment has seemed necessary by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers the passages added have been italicized,
457,458.0,information retrieval systems lancaster  this book is concerned primarily with those intellectual factors that significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems namely indexing policy and practice vocabulary control searching strategies interaction between the system and its users my viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems i have therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements the book does not concern itself except indirectly with equipment for the implementation of retrieval systems a topic that is adequately covered by other volumes in this seris moreover it is my contention that the importance of hardware and data processing aspects of information systems has been exaggerated in the united states with some detriment to the performance of many systems,
458,459.0,information retrieval on line lancaster  this book deals with on line systems for bibliographic search and retrieval the literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systems are appearing all the time we have attempted to provide a broad survey of the characteristics capabilities and limitations of present systems our emphasis is on the design evaluation and use of on line retrieval systems primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of information services it is oriented toward the intellectual aspects of information retrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects we hope that this book may have some value for all students of library and information science,
459,460.0,information retrieval and documentation in chemistry davis  for several years we have thought that greater effort should be expended to create more understanding of the processes involved in information storage retrieval and dissemination too often concepts deriving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarily abstruse either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort of mystique this book is intended to explicate if not popularize major aspects of i s r processes as they are exemplified by the field of chemical documentation to the extent that this work is found useful by chemists information specialists and all individuals interested in scientific documentation we shall be gratified,
460,461.0,information retrieval and processing doyle  the present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect the fact that the reader of today s book is much more likely to be an interested college student with a great awareness of the current information revolution than was the case ten years ago thus hardware materials and processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first in chapters two through four the subject of information retrieval per se begins with chapters five and six which have to do with librarianship and documentation because of their somewhat historical slant these chapters along with seven are the only ones taken from the 1963 book which adhere to their original character chapter seven presents a simplified concept of an information system and its components and paves the way for discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow especially for data retrieval in chapter eight and document retrieval in chapter nine chapters ten through twelve on language processing evaluation and user studies describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have developed strongly since 1963,
461,462.0,information retrieval rijsbergen  the material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate information or computer science students postgraduate library science students and research workers in the field of ir some of the chapters particularly chapter 6 make simple use of a little advanced mathematics however the necessary mathematical tools can be easily mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and in any case references have been given where the mathematics occur,
462,463.0,information retrieval british and american 1876 1976 metcalfe  of eight chapters this first one deals with principles and definitions and then with the slow development of information retrieval through about 5 000 years until the introduction of printing in europe less than 500 years prior to our period of principal coverage 1876 1976 this latter period coincides with the second century of the united states of america during which were intensified earlier efforts to carry out one of washington s urgings in his farewell address promote then as an object of primary importance institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge,
463,464.0,similarity relations and fuzzy orderings zaden  the notion of similarity as defined in this paper is essentially a generalization of the notion of equivalence in the same vein a fuzzy ordering is a generalization of the concept of ordering for example the relation x y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers more correctly a similarity relation s is a fuzzy relation which is reflexive symmetric and transitive various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are investigated and as an illustration an extended version of szpilrajn s theorem is proved,
464,465.0,using commercially available literature tapes for a current awareness service corbett  the paper reviews the need for current awareness services and describes the basic characteristics of sdi indicating its advantages details are given of the problems that have arisen in providing an sdi service based on chemical titles tapes at aldermaston with particular reference to program limitations data on operating costs and on use assessments of the service are given the pros and cons of title only alerting systems are discussed,
465,466.0,the university of sheffield biomedical information project barkla  an outline is given of the history of the project and the development with osti support of an information service in intestinal absorption which is intended to become self supporting results of an evaluation of computer based current awareness techniques including journal scanning is discussed with reference to cost completeness and minimum delay a simple technique is suggested for profile construction e g for chemical titles computer search based on frequency and specificity of words in a sample of relevant titles,
466,467.0,exploitation of literature on tape rowlands  experience of the use of a number of commercially available magnetic tapes for a current awareness service is described difficulties encountered in the assimilation of various types of tape format into the system developed for the unilever research laboratory are discussed and problems in the retrospective searching of tapes are outlined,
467,468.0,analysis of on line searching costs robertson  datta  a project was undertaken to discover the major determinants of the costs of searching on line on a practical reference retrieval system scisearch the methodology and some results of this project are reported controlled searches were undertaken to isolate the effect of each of a number of variables a model involving several of the major variables was then developed the general approach proved to be in this case both feasible and useful,
468,469.0,the phenomena of interest to information science neveling  discusses the various explicit and implicit definitions of information and information science against a view of their historical development shows how the various views of information science overlap with other disciplines and concludes with a proposal for a definition of information science based on social need a schema of information sciences is put forward with the plea that any discussion of information and information science should first declare the definitions to be used,
469,470.0,information service in libraries crowley  the two studies presented here represent efforts to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive fashion that is to apply certain tests generally similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing attention to the fact that a test is being carried out the two projects were rather different as to purpose method and reliability of result that is statistical significance dr crowley s investigation the first in point of time arose partly from his experience in a county library his curiousity about the real result of the reference activities as different from merely counting the questions answered led him to ask is there substantial difference between the claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual result as observed in a number of different situations by individuals posing as clients the study which followed from this question was then exploratory and necessarily less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this pair,
470,471.0,information storage and retrieval tools elements theories becker  this textbook grew out of some discussions between the authors about the interdisciplinary character of the field of information storage and retrieval we both felt that the need existed to show what each professional group concerned with the solution of information storage and retrieval problems could contribute a university level course was developed based on the concept that each person should be made aware of how others could help him the course was presented about a dozen times over the ensuing years and this book is based on it,
471,472.0,information storage and retrieval systems for individual researchers jahoda  this book deals with the simplest of the three corrective measures the improvement of the document retrieval system there are different ways and means of accomplishing this and these methods of improving the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the principal topics to be covered the book is addressed primarily to the researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his document collection or start an index to his document collection but does not quite know how to go about it an index is herein defined as a systematic organization of a collection of documents or data there are indexes to various types of document and data collections and there are various types of indexes examples of familiar indexes are indexes to individual books to collections of books the card catalog in a library to the contents of journals or periodicals for example the reader s guide to periodical literature to collections of facts for example a telephone directory or to numeric data such as physical constants of a group of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study,
472,473.0,bibliographic coupling extended in time ten case histories kessler  the methods of bibliographic coupling were applied to 8186 papers in thirty five volumes of the physical review vol 77 1950 to vol 111 1958 the results are reported in the form of ten case histories each case was chosen to illustrate a problem in information retrieval,
473,474.0,a methodology for test and evaluation of information retrieval systems goffman  newill  a recognition of the importance of useful evaluative techniques is an indirect or secondary result of the hugely expanded national investment in scientific research such recognition has followed the expenditure of much time and money on the development of information systems which utilize advances in information handling and data processing primarily computer oriented to handle the explosion of recorded information information scientists from a typically diverse group of parent disciplines are now cooperating not only to develop methodologies of evaluation of such systems but to apply them,
474,475.0,factors affecting the preferences of industrial personnel for information gathering methods rosenberg  a structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in industrial and government organizations asking the subjects to rank eight information gathering methods according to their preference in given hypothetical situation the subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a seven point scale according to a ease of use and b amount of information expected the subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time spent in research or research related activities the groups were designated research and nonresearch a statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects 52 in research 44 in nonresearch showed that no statistically significant differences were present in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel the results of the study infer that the ease of use of an information gathering method is more important than the amount of information expected for information gathering methods in industrial and government regardless of the research orientation of the users,
475,476.0,on the articulation of surrogates an attempt at an epistemological foundation perreault  there are two major purposes in mind for this gathering the first is the most general that can be proposed for any gathering the simple advantage of bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least a small class of problems especially when this problem has not previously benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators to further such thematic collaboration the formal presentations have been scheduled no more than three each day with time left after each presentation for formal discussion here in the conference room and with as much time as possible given the number of presentations left free for informal discussion the second purpose is one of even greater necessity in my opinion though one not so obvious as the first over and above the hope for interchange of what has already been thought out in the form of personal contact where the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the printed word in its usual and ineffable way it is my hope that we will all be able especially in our informal discussions to penetrate beyond mere similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic relationship,
476,477.0,some remarks on information languages their analysis and comparison soergel  the machine language information language in our terminology d s should not be confused with the machine code upenskii 59 357 in ranganathan s more general terms there should be no confusion between the idea plane and the notational plane many difficulties in classification arise from this confusion this paper is devoted mainly to problems on the idea plane the ir language i want to talk about is the language in which the information to be retrieved is formulated i e a declarative sentence language not the imperative sentence language of the programmer retriever bohnert in samet 62 1 10 that is the information language should not be confused with the programming language to avoid misunderstandings it would perhaps be better to say descriptive instead of declarative and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative may be described which is however not to be executed by the system but to be retrieved by appropriate searches,
477,478.0,concept organization for information retrieval farradane  all analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them the concepts may be just words descriptors as in simple post co ordinate keyword indexing systems or they may be class terms or other idea groupings as in classifications the relations between concepts often appear to be absent but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or questioner and other relations possible between the words would lead to false drops classification has traditionally been a method of organization of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed in the form of groupings called classes,
478,479.0,automatic term classifications and retrieval sparck jones  needham  recent research at the cambridge language research unit has been concerned with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with the theory of clumps to document description obtained from the aslib cranfield project and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval a substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co occurrences in document descriptions and finds classes of terms with strong similarity connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its complement and which retrieves using single terms and or term classes according to specification and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets of requests serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and with different modes of using term classes are still in progress so on definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are presented,
479,480.0,some structural characteristics of articulated subject indexes armitage  lynch  an articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to organize the noun phrases as subject headings with subordinate displays of the remainder of the phrases the best known example of the articulated subject index is that to chemical abstracts it has been shown that a well defined transformation links the entry as it appears in the index with the original phrase in natural order as it was first compiled by the indexer a reverse transformation can be used to generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more prepositions or connectives a simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives or words acting as gerunds or participles a sorting algorithm has also been developed the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to greatest organization in the index display deviations from the model in manually produced indexes are described the potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval is examined,
480,481.0,integrated information processing and the case for a national network dammers  the various premises which need consideration when developing a realistic and flexible information storage retrieval and dissemination isrd system are discussed their implication is illustrated with some examples from the development of the system at shell research sittingbourne one of the factors which will affect the satisfactory performance of an isrd system is the ease with which relevant literature information not held in the system can be provided the later part of the paper is developed to a discussion of this problem and of a possible means of dealing with it in the not too distant future,
481,482.0,some experiments in the selective dissemination of information in the field of plasma physics anthony  cheney  whelan  a small scale computer based sdi system in plasma physics and the related subjects is described briefly the system serves about 100 research scientists and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs the implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is discussed some comparison of the costs of the computer based system with those of a manual system is made further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to external users on a world wide basis the aim being to compare under controlled conditions the parameters of the small scale internal service with those of an external service on a wide scale the paper concludes with some observations on the future development and organization of computer assisted services their possibilities and the main problems which are likely to arise,
482,483.0,performance of automatic information systems lesk  the smart document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for text analysis and request searching results from three document collections indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus lookup while phrase matching procedures statistical association methods and concept hierarchies are useful for special applications automatic document clustering schemes and use interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of large collections abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete texts proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests are discussed the practicality of large scale document centers and their proper design are considered in light of these results,
483,484.0,negotiation of inquiries in an on line retrieval system hillman  the focus of discussion is a prototype retrieval system with three major components for text processing connectivity and decision operations each of these components is based on a distinguishable subtheory computer programs for the first two components have been written for a ge 225 computer the complete prototype system is now being programmed for operation in a time shared environment it is a user oriented system with planned capabilities for the browsing and man machine interaction a major goal is to develop procedures whereby research workers can conduct an on line dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information each user submitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to vocabulary or form the system converses with the user to obtain source derived phrases that elaborate and refine the initial inquiry the use is led to browse in the general area of his inquiry and to broaden or narrow it as a further aid to request formulation evaluation of system performance is described,

485,486.0,relevance assessments and retrieval system evaluation lesk  salton  two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information retrieval system are respectively the recall and the precision since the determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that query it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate generally valid evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures a study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision it thus appears that properly computed recall and precision data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many distinct user classes,
486,487.0,an indirect method of information retrieval goffman  the information retrieval process treated strictly as a matching procedure has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query and that it overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document depends upon what is already known about the subject and in term affects the relevance of other documents subsequently examined a mathematical model of a search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers the results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct method no spurious material was retrieved by either method,

488,489.0,experiments in book indexing by computer borko  the most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance purposes while a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive basis automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining and selecting good and useful index terms two principles of selection are proposed specification and selection of useful terms and specification and exclusion of useless terms because of the nebulous nature and meaning of good index terms and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms for their selection this research in automatic indexing is based on the principle of excluding useless terms even so fully automatic indexing was not achieved in this study single words proved to be little value as index terms multiple word terms were generated by the computer but no algorithm could successfully eliminate the useless phrases final selection had to be made by the experimenter a comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using machine aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques,
489,490.0,computer use in information and data handling an appraisal of its economic aspects dammers  the economic merits of applying computers in information storage retrieval and dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of operating the information services concerned this had tended to indicate that computer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in the large scale organizations the present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs involved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system representing the information services and its users it is suggested that the inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application in information work in fact such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic justification in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users to illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in research data handling and the operation of sdi services in an industrial research establishment,

540,541.0,isbd s and title main entry for serials spalding  at the ifla liverpool conference in 1971 a joint working group of the committees on cataloguing and on serial publications was set up to draw up an international standard bibliographic description for serials taking the isbd m as a model in so far as practicable as might be expected the special problems presented by serial publications made the task of developing an isbd s a difficult assignment which the joint working group tackled with great energy and devotion the successive drafts were prepared by the chairman and the secretary mlle m l bossuat and mlle m pelletier probably no data element presented such a severe problem as that of serial title the seemingly countless mitteilungen memoires proceedings bulletins trudy s and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified a solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper with a wedding ring consisting of a space hyphen space and dubbing the happy couple the distinctive title,
541,542.0,towards a theory of the concept dahlberg  a concept is regarded as the common element of both classification systems and thesauri reality and knowledge are not represented by words or terms but by the meanings behind these tokens a concept of say an object a property of an object a process etc is derived from verbal statements on these as subjects and may therefore be defined as the whole of true and possible predicates that can be collected on a given subject it is from these predicates that the characteristics of the corresponding concepts can be derived common characteristics in different concepts lead to relations between concepts which relations in turn are factors for the formation of concept systems different kinds of relationships as well as different kinds of concepts are distinguished it is pointed out that an orderly supply of the elements for propositions information statements on new knowledge requires the construction and availability of such concept systems,
542,543.0,impact of scientific serials on the advancement of medical knowledge an objective method of analysis sengupta  a common tool for the selection of serial publications for a research library is the lists of most cited serials the possibilities of this method were first studied by gross and gross who in 1927 applied a method of sample statistical investigation to the grading of scientific serials according to their relative importance based on citation counting from source journals,
543,544.0,the nature of scientific communication and influence crane  as the formal communication system of science has become less able to supply information with the rapidity that scientists require increasing attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science how are scientific publications utilized by scientists what is accomplished by the circulation of scientific information on an informal basis how does the social organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes three types of studies have been conducted in this area a studies of the scientific literature itself b studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research and c studies of the relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas for the most part studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies libbey and zaltman 1967 p 64 paisley 1968 storer 1968 p 12 the lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone a useful theory must integrate knowledge from all three types in this article we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose,
544,545.0,the literature of the social sciences a survey of citation studies broadus  the great concern with scientific communication in the last few decades has produced a number of studies analyzing the use of information one approach to these matters has been via the citation study a method often used in the physical sciences but applied less frequently in the humanities and social sciences however in the latter area enough citation studies have been completed to produce material for interesting comparisons,

547,548.0,the computer library interface the last five years balmforth  grose  jeffreys  university printing presses exist and are subsidized by the government for the purpose of producing books which no one can read and they are true to their high calling books are the sources of material for lectures they should be kept from the young for to read books and remember what you read well enough to reproduce it is called cramming and this is destructive of all true education the best way to protect the young from books is first to make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years training a lecturer is a sound scholar who is chosen to teach on the ground that he was once able to learn eloquence is not permissible in a lecture it is a privilege reserved by stature for the public orator,
548,549.0,the intergroup conflict sherif  in one broad category of theories the problems are expressed in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they exist in everyday life on the whole theories advanced by many social scientists fall in this broad category in this concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously in the second broad category of theories problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous appearing concepts and units of analysis theories coming from psychologists and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within this broad category in this line of approach theories are advanced without due regard to actualities and consequently they are plagued with serious questions of validity,
549,550.0,interlibrary loan involving academic libraries thomson  interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the united states numbered over 800 000 items in 1963 64 this number is growing exponentially large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third of the interlibrary loan requests they receive unfilled interlibrary loans are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the usefulness of the service to the reader many of these interlibrary loan failures are preventable chiefly by publishing policies of the lending libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted,
550,551.0,interlibrary loan policies directory thomson  in 1972 73 approximately 194 000 interlibrary loan requests were not filled because the borrowing library in ignorance requested non circulating material contrary to the interlibrary lending policies of the lending library these unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending libraries over 400 000 in wasted manpower besides disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check in advance the lending policies before sending requests the major elements determining whether or not libraries receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists especially the national union catalog the union list of serials and new serial titles and whether it has strong collections in a subject field listed in library directories volume of out of state lending is related to the type of lending library the size of collection budget for current acquisitions number of periodicals received photocopy charges population density in neighboring states proximity to other libraries and completeness of reporting holdings in the national union catalog or other bibliographic centers,

552,553.0,an introduction to computers in information science artandi  this book is an introduction to the field of information science and technology with particular emphasis on document organization its point of view is general in the sense that it attempts to deal with types of problems rather than particular systems when particular systems are described they are used as examples of systems rather than as models the method of presentation is expository at the introductory level while differing points of view are frequently noted this book is not intended to provide definitive critical evaluation relevant research is reviewed in order to indicate current thinking and activities in the field,
553,554.0,introduction to information science saracevic  the main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical and experimental nature rather than on practical applications however the articles selected are viewed as having a considerable potential in two major respects they have important implications for the practice of information handling but even more important they contain aspects of generalization the book is oriented toward basic and experimental work such as that performed by traditional sciences with the hope that a reader may find much relevant to his own interests educational level and background a bridge toward generalizations a feeling of interconnection between seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or found in the literature an awareness of apparent gaps in knowledge and even ideas for practical solutions or further theoretical or experimental work,
554,555.0,introduction to library science basic elements of library service shera j h  librarianship classifies as a social science because the library as an institution is a creature of society and its goal is the improvement of society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of which he is a part but the library is also concerned with man as a rational being thus it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise the traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated and librarianship in both its technology and its services is drawing ever closer to the social and physical sciences but we would do well to remind ourselves of the library s humanistic origins otherwise in excessive enthusiasm for the technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist we may lose sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit in them,
555,556.0,introduction to subject indexing a programmed text brown  this programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out under a research project funded by the office for scientific and technical information now the british library research and development department the project designed to investigate the applicability of the techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject indexing was conducted at the school of librarianship the polytechnic of north london in cooperation with the college of librarianship wales the programmed instruction course written during this project and used by students at both schools of librarianship forms the basis of the programmed text most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages our intention in the above mentioned project was to produce a course of programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular system,
556,557.0,introduction to systems philosophy laszlo  the general systems theory pioneered by von bertalanffy kenneth boulding anatol rapoport and their collaborators gives us a theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific information and philosophic meaning extended into a general systems philosophy this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles by ordering the formerly random segments into a meaningful pattern if made good use of this instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated answers through the cross fertilization of contemporary science and philosophy this then is my credo the conviction which led to the formulation of the present introduction to systems philosophy over a period of three years of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection,
557,558.0,introduction to theoretical linguistics lyons  this is a introductory book in the sense that it does not presuppose any previous training in the subject but it does assume that the reader especially the reader whose educational background like my own is more in the humanities than in mathematics and science is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respect to the use of symbols and formulae few subjects suffer more than linguistics from the separation of the sciences and the humanities that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad universities for contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously and in roughly equal measure upon the more traditional approach to language that is characteristic of the humanities and the more scientific approach that has developed recently in connection with advances that have been made in formal logic computer science and automata theory,
558,559.0,introduction to university library administration thompson  the last ten years have witnessed the growth of an intense public interest in university affairs almost anything to do with universities is now headline news previously such attention as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class newspapers of appointments awards and meetings leavened once a year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the boat race all this has changed as michael befoff comments in his book the plateglass universities having made the foregoing points and more besides what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls he goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers money they represent a massive investment on the part of the government and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year the total university student population is in excess of two hundred thousand and teaching and research staff number approximately twenty five thousand,
559,560.0,indivisible colleges diffusion of knowledge in scientific communities crane  in the last two decades dramatic increases in the scope and volume of scientific research have occurred as may be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientific literature is doubling approximately every ten years price 1963 for the scientist who needs to locate particular items of scientific information and for the documentation specialist who must make them readily available the organization and management of this huge and expanding store of information is a serious problem increasingly radical solutions are being proposed for example some experts would like to scrap scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively,
560,561.0,a dynamic programming approach to r and d budgeting and project selection hess  contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time between a project s proposal and its commercialization the sequential decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1 the research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable investment for commercialization and 2 an allocation to a project today does not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods the research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into account the sequential decision characteristic utilizing the technique of dynamic programming methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or unconstrained these models also suggest a rational explanation of the patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice finally some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit their practical application are discussed,
561,562.0,the association factor in information retrieval stiles  this paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact terms of the request and can present these documents in the order of their relevance to the request the key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms with proper manipulation of these associations entirely within the machine a vocabulary of synonyms near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore by noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document and with due regard for their degree of association documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request,
562,563.0,a study of methods for systematically abbreviating english words and names ford  this study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating english words and names most of the attention was given to the techniques which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose digital computer particular was paid to techniques that could process incoming information without prior knowledge of its existence i e no table lookups thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described in addition most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a quantitative measure of comparison,
563,564.0,automatic document classification bernick  starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with computers the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds to construct an empirically based mathematically derived classification system by use of a factor analysis technique the documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects and the resulting classification serves as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue words and which therefore could be automatically classified 44 documents or 48 9 per cent were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula these results are almost identical to the results obtained by maron in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula the experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique,

581,582.0,title indexes as alerting services in the chemical and life sciences bottle  the principles underlying alerting services are discussed general alerting services as distinct from sdi systems need to transfer to their users a large quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible as title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common the user needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a documents title this is estimated to be 20 25 but can vary with subject and type of information sought if a search of say chemical titles is made ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants only about one third of the significant information will be recovered synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed delay times and time of use are the two most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for some typical services,
582,583.0,evaluation of a kwic index for library literature brodie  a librarian attempting to do a literature search currently faces an eight month gap in access to the literature of his field through library literature in april 1968 librarians made a rare examination of their own literature and considered this gap and other information problems in librarianship the albany conference on the bibliographic control of library science literature recommended the establishment of a fast announcement service for library schools 1 a monthly keyword in context kwic index serving the whole range of information oriented professions was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference group to meet the need for current information 2,
583,584.0,the practice of charging users for information services a state of the art report penner  the state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet come to the point that paying for library information services is a common thing it was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the services let alone charge for them does not exist while some data on specific cost for unit operations are available it is very difficult to compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures nevertheless there is an indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the point that they are cost according their operations which would permit them to establish realistic fees for their services,
584,585.0,towards a metascience of information informatology debons  arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on information are phenomena the principles of which provide the basis for a metascience of information informatology the fundamental character of the phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and communication functions the role of the metascience is dictated by several factors namely the need for a common basis upon which all information oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned in some form or other with information on one side and man s relationship to the phenomena on the other side the content of the postulated metascience of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems for which the science has to provide answers and solutions it is suggested that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of information be developed and implemented,
585,586.0,an evaluation of index medicus and medlars in the field of ophthalmology virgo  an evaluation of the performance of index medicus and medlars in the field of ophthalmology is presented using data generated by a separate study medlars performance figures gave a screened precision ratio of 54 and a recall ratio of 42 over the same set of questions index medicus had a screened precision ratio of 53 and a recall ratio of 46 results for index medicus alone over a large set of questions gave a 73 screened precision ratio and a 47 recall ratio a random sample of medlars and index medicus precision and recall failures showed that most of the index medicus recall failures resulted from manual searcher omission the major causes of medlars precision failures were inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts at providing too exhaustive a search,
586,587.0,obsolescence of special library periodicals sampling errors and utility contours brookes  problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed the relatively large errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated when the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less to solve this problem the concept of utility contours is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p library it is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable every special library must be regarded as a special case rather than suggest new measurements therefore the paper offers simple graphical techniques that are applicable to any other special case,

588,589.0,are titles of chemical papers becoming more informative tocatlian  the efficiency of key work in context kwic permuted title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors choices of titles for their papers titles are important not only in commercial services such as chemical titles basic current contents and ca condensates but also in scanning primary journals and in traditional library services such as bibliographies it is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as carriers of information the present study was undertaken to test whether 1 titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and 2 whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the kwic index in 1958 the first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948 1958 and 1968 by the following criteria 1 a count of substantive words in the title 2 a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract with and without the use of a thesaurus and 3 a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract with and without the use of a thesaurus the second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles with 3 or less substantive words published in 1948 1958 and 1968 results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the kwic index,
589,590.0,toward a theory of indexing ii rush  the purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a theory of information storage and retrieval it is believed that this theory can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing after stating basic premises and defining essential concepts the relationship between a theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is considered the similarities between the indexing process and the general communication process are discussed and indexing is viewed as an order increasing i e entropy decreasing operation the concept of a theoretical index is developed and contrasted with real world indexing systems the relationship between query formulation retrieval and benefit is discussed and these notions are then related to the human performance variable it is believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework for more detailed investigations into the indexing process,

591,592.0,some remarks on elitism in information and the invisible college phenomenon in science price  let me remind you of that famous place in dickins pickwick papers where we hear of a researcher who composed a copious review on chinese metaphysics with the aid only of the encyclopedia britannica which contained absolutely no information on that subject the technique used we are told with a nudge of superiority was to read for metaphysics under the letter m and for china under the letter c and to combine the information i feel that we may be performing just such a miracle of creative juxtaposition when we assume that scientific information is just some special variety of information that contains queer words like potassium permanganate pi r squared and numbers like 2 71828 we suppose too that scientific libraries are just libraries that happen to be full of scientific books and that the best possible technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a library qualification and combined it with the appropriate sort of technical qualification there is as they used to say no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical compound i wish to point out two simple facts there is more to scholarship than the mere cumulation storage and retrieval of information and there is about science and technology something intrinsically different from mere scholarship,

593,594.0,on line systems promise and pitfalls cuadra  interactive systems in existence for nearly 15 years are becoming increasingly important both for information retrieval and library support operations the virtues of these systems are speed intimacy and if time sharing is involved economy the major problems are the cost of the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data the still high cost of communications and the generally poor design of the user system interfaces the desirable features of on line retrieval interfaces are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way e g by the national library of medicine in its aim twx nationwide experimental retrieval service system implementers must in addition to engineering the right capabilities into on line systems also make a careful concerted effort to engineer user acceptance common pitfalls here include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account the social context around the user terminal the major national problem is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data bases that will be readily available during the next few years we do not need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of on line systems but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for technological change,
594,595.0,selected results from an inquiry into testing of information retrieval systems saracevic  a variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were examined a model of a retrieval system together with a set of measures and a methodology for performance testing were developed in the main experiment the effect on performance of the following variables was tested sources of indexing indexing languages coding schemes question analyses search strategies and formats of output in addition a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate the problems of controls in experimentation with ir systems the main conclusions the human factor appears to be the main variable in all components of an ir system length of indexes affects performance considerably more than indexing languages question analyses and search strategies to affect performance to a great extent as much if not more than indexing retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only on a general level failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific it seems that testing of total ir systems controlling and monitoring all factors environmental and systems related is not possible at present,
595,596.0,what makes an automatic keyword classification effective barber  though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval purposes automatically is not a new one comparatively few systematic experiments have been carried out in this area and while many suggestions have been put forward not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic keyword classifications and hence about the properties such classifications should have and the ways they should be used in previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations these tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected nonfrequent keywords when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms particularly for requests and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency,

609,610.0,the development of a semantic differential to assess users attitudes towards an on line interactive reference retrieval system katzer  a semantic differential sd is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts each sd consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts in relation to the object or concept of interest to interpret completed sds it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters the primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters or dimensions applied by a user of an on line user oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system seventy one who used or were familiar with a working on line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 sds each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales the correlations among the scales were factor analyzed three independent dimensions were identified factor i was labeled evaluative specific and accounted for over 23 of the total variance factor ii was called desirability it accounted for over 17 of the total variance and factor iii entitled enormity accounted for over 10 of the total variance another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable therefore if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading in order to construct a working semantic differential 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions brief instructions are included which outline how to use this sd the discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study,
610,611.0,what information dissemination studies imply concerning the design of on line reference retrieval systems back  the use of an on line computer system for locating bibliographic citations has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the information explosion however on line reference retrieval is only one element in a large social system of information dissemination to have a widespread impact an on line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources of references this paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a basis for determining how on line retrieval can best compete it recommends the functional groups for whom an on line system should be designed and the forms of written media that should be included in the system s initial data base finally it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods,

623,624.0,clinician search for information friedlander  the use of a medical library by members of the faculty of a medical school was studied by questionnaire in an effort to ascertain the part the library played among channels of communication in work related information searches the study described the population of users and the kinds of sources they utilized in an information search in an effort to identify the factors influencing their choice of kinds of sources and leading to the possibility of predicting use of kinds of source once the characteristics of the users were known it brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy to use the tabulations show the importance of co workers in informal communication low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was apparent the main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to use in the treatment of his patients the recommendations were made that journals should be shelved accessibly with index medicus nearby books might be shelved less accessibly telephone access to the library is of major importance as is the provision of adequate photocopying facilities,
624,625.0,on selecting a measure of retrieval effectiveness cooper  it is argued that a user s subjective evaluation of the personal utility of a retrieval system s output to him if it could be properly quantified would be a near ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness a hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by means of an elicitation procedure because the hypothetical methodology is impractical compromise methods are outlined and their underlying simplifying assumptions are discussed the more plausible the simplifying assumptions on which a performance measure is based the better the measure this along with evidence gleaned from validation experiments of a certain kind is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure of effectiveness to use under given test conditions,

626,627.0,theoretical foundations of thesaurus construction and some methodological considerations for thesaurus updating kim  it was argued that the present day thesaurus construction and maintenance rules and conventions are not theoretically based for this reason there are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus consequently most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and retrieval systems are not systematically updated in order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated a survey was conducted the working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature one way communication allowing no reciprocal feedback if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication both way communication the survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone no attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating it was however argued that such a theory if developed should at least account for the concepts of meaning and knowledge within this theoretical framework two techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating of a thesaurus,
627,628.0,the environment of classification the concept of mutual exclusivity jones  it has been suggested that information science is still of the stage of alchemy if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its philosopher s stone mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the observable universe that this is so is displayed through a series of examples some of these relate to everyday things like trees beaches and man himself whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes the act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem nevertheless mutual exclusivity must form part of man s mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication the dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable finally it is observed that out standing genius appears to pay scant regard to existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an integrated approach to problems,
628,629.0,promotion of information services an evaluation of alternative approaches lazorick  this article deals with the promotion of information services specifically the formation and subsequent evaluation of different promotional programs for selective dissemination of information sdi services provided by the mechanized information center mic at the ohio state university three programs opinion leadership blitz and telephone solicitation were developed data were collected to show for each of the programs 1 the level of market penetration achieved 2 the level of user satisfaction generated from the service 3 the effect in terms of influence of the various media employed and 4 cost effectiveness data analysis focused on a determination of the most effective methods to promote sdi services,
629,630.0,a novel philosophy for the design of information storage and retrieval systems appropriate for the 70 s scheffler  the philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective alternative tool this philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent philosophy of the 60 s in which many information systems designers touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and retrieval situations important principles of information system design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy for the 70 s are presented these are the performance of users needs studies by the representative small group technique the analysis of users needs including their rank ordering by priority the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable existent information storage and retrieval system from those available the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing a model with which they can interact and provide feedback and the final design of a cost effective system a number of pitfalls arising from earlier design methodologies are pointed out and the avoidance of these pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed,

631,632.0,co citation in the scientific literature a new measure of the relationship between two documents small  a new form of document coupling called co citation is defined as the frequency with which two documents are cited together the co citation frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists of citing documents in the science citation index and counting identical entries networks of co cited papers can be generated for specific scientific specialties and an example is drawn from the literature of particle physics co citation patterns are found to differ significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns but to agree generally with patterns of direct citation clusters of co cited papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science they may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of sdi profiles,
632,633.0,use of an automatic text analyzer in preparation of sdi profiles carroll  tague  the conventional method of preparing sdi selective dissemination of information profiles often necessitates detailed interview sessions between the client and one or more information scientists this research shows that by submitting samples of the client s recent professional reading material to automatic text analysis sdi profiles can be prepared that result in significantly higher initial recall scores than do those prepared by conventional techniques relevance scores are not significantly different,
633,634.0,on selecting a measure of retrieval effectiveness part ii implementation of the philosophy cooper  it was argued in part i see jasis march april 1973 p 87 that the best way to evaluate a retrieval system is in principle at least to elicit subjective estimates of the system s utility to its users quantified in terms of the numbers of utilities e g dollars they would have been willing to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system and a naive methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis but the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions how can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology and how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while in the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up the first answers the questions in terms of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from the naive measure to the proposed substitute the second answers it by experimentation,
634,635.0,clustering of scientific journals carpenter  narin  a cluster analysis procedure is described in which 188 journals in the discipline of physics chemistry and molecular biology are grouped into clusters most of the clusters are easily identified as subdisciplinary subject areas the data source was the cross citing amongst the journals derived from the journal citation index jci a file derived in turn from the science citation index sci the jci consists of journal by journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal processed in the sci two step citation maps linking the clusters are presented for each discipline within the disciplines the clusters of journals form fully transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts,
635,636.0,text searching retrieval of answer sentences and other answer passages o connor  some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes on occasions determined by the computer multi sentence sequences since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer providing documents answer passages are retrieved an answer passage is a passage which is either answer providing or answer indicative i e it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer providing in most cases answer sentences i e single sentence answer passages are retrieved this has great advantages for screening retrieval output two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described one approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening syntactic joints roughly speaking prepositions conjunctions and punctuation marks between successive clue words the other measure uses word proximity in a new way the two measures perform about equally well the computer uses enclosure and connector words for determining when a multi sentence passage should be retrieved however no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi paragraph answer passages which were the only answer passages occurring in 6 of the papers in a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer providing documents 7 of those to be retrieved because of one multi paragraph answer passage and one complete failure of clue word selection for the other answer providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than smart which has produced the best previously reported recall precision results the retrieval questions mostly from real users and documents used in this study were from the field of information science the results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a soft science and it is reasonable to hope that in less soft sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better on this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted,
636,637.0,breaking the communication barrier between searcher and literature file an interactive guide schultz  the challenges of design of programming systems file organization and manipulation and user oriented query languages have held the spotlight in the development of data processing support to systems for retrieval of scientific literature at biosis development of such a system from the pragmatic viewpoint of providing viable self supporting retrieval service from a data base of more than two million references has resulted in focusing attention on supporting the formulation of the information need into an effective computer search specification developed under cps and now implemented under cics the program claims no novelty of structure or technique but constitutes an innovation in application and goal with primary emphasis on accommodating the behavior of a user not previously knowledgeable about the structure indexing language and detailed content of a machine based references file,
637,638.0,densities of use and absence of obsolescence in physics journals at m i t sandison  chen s data for the raw frequency of use of 138 physics journals in the science library at m i t are re examined and converted to densities of use per meter of shelf other units of size for obtaining densities and their measurement are discussed there is no evidence for synchronous obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals instead there is some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with greater age similar evidence elsewhere is cited the ranking order for heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies to densities of use it is suggested that for comparing the relative values of different journals or age groups in library use or citation studies analyses of raw frequencies are valueless and indeed potentially dangerously misleading until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each group examined,
638,639.0,costs and effectiveness in the evolution of an information system a case study standera  with budget constraints the problems of cost and effectiveness have advanced to the top of priority list of all information services managers determining and monitoring effectiveness should be cost effective also the author traces the cost effectiveness problems back to the genesis of an information system performance parameters and their shifting in the desired direction are briefly discussed the monthly statement is intended to assist a manager in budgeting and planning and it should also alert him to any irregularities in costs and effectiveness either in time or among individual services if adopted more widely it could even serve as a means of comparison between centers if due consideration is given to varying conditions,
639,640.0,the scientific premises of information science rosenberg  throughout my years of work as an information scientist i have been plagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to the field a central theme of every conference that i have attended related to what is information science or is information science a science in this paper i hope to take these questions head on i must begin by saying that i do take information science seriously as a science i see it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and man s interaction with it that we lack so much in this quest for understanding is the greatest challenge of the science i intend to explore the tradition or world view bearing on the scientific study of information the currently prevalent world view is the scientific tradition which extends from the enlightenment to the present i also intend to look critically at what i perceive to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand the phenomenon of information the criticism will by necessity be speculative i intend to stick my neck out not because i can prove my assertions but because i believe these ideas must be discussed,
640,641.0,representation of concept relations using the tosar system of the idc treatise iii on information retrieval theory fugmann  nickelsen  nickelsen  winter  successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the particular language of the system and on the predictability of this representation if an index language is employed predictability is guaranteed and the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity of the representation i e by the extent to which conceptual distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided the various index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity differences in their performance are correspondingly great the lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts we describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds the points of such a graph are occupied by concepts and the connecting lines between these points represent concept relations in a special field of chemistry these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language text,
641,642.0,making on line search available in an industrial research environment lawrence  weil  graham  on line interactive searching of several information bases through several service operators was introduced in an industrial research environment thorough knowledge of the information base and its structure in the search system is a major factor of successful searching and differences among search systems do not present serious barriers this new technique was most effectively used when the information specialist and the scientist searched as a team on line searching is now an established search tool at exxon research and engineering company,
642,643.0,a theory of term importance in automatic text analysis salton  yang  a good deal of work has been done over the years in an attempt to use statistical or probabilistic techniques as a basis of automatic indexing and content analysis unfortunately many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness and the more refined procedures are computationally unattractive a new technique known as discrimination value analysis ranks the text words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documents of a collection from each other that is the value of a term depends on how much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given term is assigned for content identification the best words are those which achieve the greatest separation the discrimination value analysis is computationally simple and it assigns a specific role in content analysis to single words juxtaposed words and phrases and word groups or thesaurus categories experimental results are given showing the effectiveness of the technique,
643,644.0,a decision theoretic foundation for indexing bookstein  swanson  the indexing of a document is among the most crucial steps in preparing that document for retrieval the adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of the system to respond to patron requests this paper discusses this process and document retrieval in general on the basis of formal decision theory the basic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system both models are fully defined in this paper though the main purpose of this paper is to provide insights into a very complex process formulae are developed that may prove to be of value for an automated operating system the paper concludes with an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of view of decision theory,

647,648.0,user training for on line information retrieval systems moghdam  the early 1970 s have clearly shown a trend toward the use of on line systems as the ideal medium for information retrieval the emphasis placed on direct access by the practitioners in the field rather than delegated searches through information specialists leads to the growing need for an efficient design in training transient user groups printed manuals live help audiovisual presentations and on line instructions have all been used with varying degrees of success the author contends that the use of computer assisted instruction in conjunction with the on line information retrieval system is the most promising form of instruction in that the medium itself as well as the message may be used to acquaint the novice searcher with an interactive user system interface,
648,649.0,a probabilistic approach to automatic keyword indexing part i on the distribution of specialty words in a technical literature harter  the problem studied in this research is that of developing a set of formal statistical rules for the purpose of identifying the keywords of a document words likely to be useful as index terms for that document the research was prompted by the observation made by a number of writers that non specialty words words which possess little value for indexing purposes tend to be distributed at random in a collection of documents in contrast specialty words are not so distributed in part i of the study a mixture of two poisson distributions is examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution and formulas expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical frequency statistics are derived the fit of the model is tested on an experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the purposes of the study a measure intended to identify specialty words consistent with the 2 poisson model is proposed and evaluated,
649,650.0,relative effectiveness of titles abstracts and subject headings for machine retrieval from the compendex services byrne  we have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles subject headings abstracts free language terms and combinations of these elements the compendex data base was used for this study since it contained all of the data elements of interest in general the results obtained from the experiments indicate that as expected titles alone are not satisfactory for efficient retrieval the combination of titles and abstracts came the closest to 100 retrieval with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well indexer input although necessary for 100 retrieval in almost all cases was found to be relatively unimportant,
650,651.0,an acquisitions decision model for academic libraries depew  a decision model for book acquisitions has been developed to simulate the intellectual processes used in acquiring these materials in academic libraries it consists of a flow chart weighted inputs and an equation which when solved indicates whether a library should add the title to its collection refer it to a cooperative group defer the decision or drop it altogether inputs to the model need further study and development but the model is a step in defining and quantifying the decision process,
651,652.0,relevance a review of and a framework for the thinking on the notion in information science saracevic  information science emerged as the third subject along with logic and philosophy to deal with relevance an elusive human notion the concern with relevance as a key notion in information science is traced to the problems of scientific communication relevance is considered as a measure of the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a communication process the different views of relevance that emerged are interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different points in the process of knowledge communication it is suggested that there exists an interlocking interplaying cycle of various systems of relevances,
652,653.0,thesaurus control the selection grouping and cross referencing of terms for inclusion in a coordinate index word list mandersloot  douglas  spicer  the selection grouping and cross referencing of the usually single word terms are based on 1 a systematic approach to indexing in depth based on earlier work and resulting in reasonably consistent indexing 2 an analytical approach to word forms in which the following categories are distinguished action forms means material means machine and means man forms states variables and latent properties for each word those forms included in a certain category are represented by a single code the category switching caused by prepositions must be taken into account 3 criteria for term splitting with limited semantic factoring occasionally semantic integration is used 4 critera for dealing with antonyms which are classified as reciprocals complements unequivalent opposites diametrical opposites and reversals 5 introduction of conditional cross referencing 6 recognition of multiword synonyms as the major difficulty in coordinate indexing,

654,655.0,the potential usefulness of catalog access points other than author title and subject cooper  library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which they have had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author title subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able to look it up easily in present day card catalogs however they may remember a surprising amount of such nonstandard information as the color of the document s cover or its approximate length could this type of nonstandard information be profitably exploited in computerized catalogs of the future such facilities if available would surely be used for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today s library patrons seek known documents and of these a substantial minority possess nonstandard information in this report the results of a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of nonstandard information are described and analyzed a ranking according to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various nonstandard book features is given it is estimated that if the average patron s nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval strategies he would only have to search through roughly one five hundredth as many documents as in a random search this reduction factor is great enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many situations,
655,656.0,measures of the usefulness of written technical information to chemical researchers kegan  the effective transfer of technology involves more than just distributing paper it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a minimum of useless ones for 1 month 10 researchers recorded a sample of the written technical information items that they received 4 months later they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful and in what ways the results indicate that 1 a researcher will call an item useful even if it does not cause him to take some action but only has some significance for him 2 the more the source of an item knows about the needs of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful 3 no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable physical arrangements and information behavior and 4 an item may prove useful not because of the information objectively contained in that item but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher s mind or a free association other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher,
656,657.0,standards for writing abstracts weil  an abstract as defined here is an abbreviated accurate representation of a document the following recommendations are made for the guidance of authors and editors so that abstracts in primary documents may be both helpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change in secondary publications and services prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings and for each separately published report pamphlet thesis monograph and patent place the abstract as early as possible in the document make the abstract as informative as the document will permit so that readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document state the purpose methods results and conclusions presented in the document either in that order or with initial emphasis on findings make each abstract self contained but concise retain the basic information and tone of the original document keep abstracts of most papers to fewer than 250 words abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words preferably on one page and abstracts of short communications to fewer than 100 words write most abstracts in a single paragraph normally employ complete connected sentences active verbs ad the third person employ standard nomenclature or define unfamiliar terms abbreviations and symbols the first time they occur in the abstract,
657,658.0,criteria used by research and development engineers in the selection of an information source allen  the criteria employed by engineers in the selection of various technical information channels in problem solving endeavors are investigated the relationships of certain criteria identified in past research to such factors as frequency of channel utilization and the rate at which engineers accept or reject technical information received from specific channels are the focal points of the study a direct relationship is founded between perceived accessibility of information channels and several objective measures of utilization whereas no definite support is found for the hypothesis that the channel perceived highest in technical quality are those used most frequently,

659,660.0,on relevance probabilistic indexing and information retrieval kuhns  this paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system the notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability the resulting technique called probabilistic indexing allows a computing machine given a request for information to make a statistical inference and derive a number called the relevance number for each document which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance the paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross referencing see and see also is based solely on the semantical closeness between index terms statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed thus given an arbitrary request consisting of one or many index term s a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected finally the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user,
660,661.0,is automatic classification a reasonable application of statistical analysis of text doyle  the statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines associative machine searching and automatic classification the former approach has been favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for new methods of dealing with the literature methods which do not resemble those of traditional libraries but automatic classification study also has been thriving some of the reasons for this are discussed the crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length and empirical data are introduced to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists each list representing a document for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36 four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds and two point to no effect previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document finally the future of automatic classification and some of the practical problems to be faced are outlined,
661,662.0,automatic indexing an experimental inquiry maron  this inquiry examines a technique for automatically classifying indexing documents according to their subject content the task in essence is to have a computing machine read a document and on the basis of the occurrence of selected clue words decide to which of many subject categories the document in question belongs this paper describes the design execution and evaluation of a modest experimental study aimed at testing empirically one statistical technique for automatic indexing,

734,735.0,journals most cited by chemists and chemical engineers barrett  barrett  the purpose of this paper is to present up to date material to indicate some of the changes that have taken place during and since world war ii for purposes of comparison the work of patterson and sheppard is represented in abbreviated form in tables 1 and 2 the results of our own study are presented as tables 3 and 4 the reader can draw several obvious conclusions about half of all the citations in tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950 s this in part reflects the present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation and its rapid expansion in recent years another striking fact is that in the journal of the american chemical society 39 5 of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself in industrial and engineering chemistry the percentage of self citations is 21 3 to some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work however it seems to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these journals in their respective fields more than 38 of the citations in industrial and engineering chemistry are to various american chemical society publications in the journal of the american chemical society more than 45 of the citations are to society publications,
735,736.0,overview of the nas nrc conference on large data bases williams  in 1971 the committee on chemical information of the national academy of sciences national research council recognized the problem of large data bases and accordingly created a subcommittee to investigate the problem and its impact on chemical information the first task of the large data base subcommittee was to survey organizations that generate and or process large data bases giering has indicated several different ways in which one can view a data base as being large it can be large in terms of having a large number of entries or records or bibliographic references it can be large in the sense of having a large number of fields or data elements which implies a degree of complexity it can be thought of as large in the sense of having a large number of searchable or selectable elements and it also can be large in the most readily understandable sense of having a large number of characters in storage,
736,737.0,the large data base file structure dilemma lefkovitz  this paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random file organization methods for handling two major applications transaction oriented systems and information storage and retrieval systems it then addresses a particular large data base dilemma not satisfactorily resolved by any of these methods and which is currently under active investigation two approaches to a solution are described one is called the hybrid inverted list the other is based upon an old technique called super imposed coding the former has been implemented and has recently been installed in an operational system some statistics related to file characteristics in this application are provided but operational cost and performance statistics are not yet available,
737,738.0,substructure searching of computer readable chemical abstracts service ninth collective index nomenclature files fisanick  mitchell  scott  stouw  the increasing availability of computer readable files of chemical nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the development of methods for performing substructure searches in which ca nomenclature terms are used as search terms substructure searches on ca index nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological searches as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of searches many data bases which contain ca index nomenclature also contain nonsubstance data thus searching of substance and nonsubstance data can often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall and relevancy profile construction aids prepared by cas make it possible for persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct nomenclature profiles for many questions,

742,743.0,a survey of the use of on line computer based scientific search services by academic libraries marshall  to explore their use of on line computer based bibliographic search services a one page questionnaire was sent to 100 academic libraries in the united states having separate departmental chemistry or science libraries an attempt was made to determine the background training of the persons performing the searches who the end users were the growth trend the funding the data bases used and the value to the users of the 73 replies 49 3 indicated use of such services while 24 6 were planning to use them primarily by faculty and graduate students of those reporting 83 3 used searchers with a background in library or information science 47 2 had a background in scientific discipline two or more on line services were used by 72 2 a majority of respondents stated that the use paid all expenses or a portion of the expenses the searches met the needs of the use most of the time in 83 3 of the cases and all of the time in 5 4,
743,744.0,semiconductor journals hawkins  using an on line literature searching system the number of papers in many journals dealing with semiconductors was determined the journals are ranked by the percentage of their contents devoted to semiconductors and by the total number of semiconductors papers are published only four journals devote over half of their contents to semiconductors papers approximately half of the 19 646 papers which were found in 91 journals appeared in eight journals,
744,745.0,a fuzzy set theoretic interpretation of linguistic hedges zadeh  a basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very more or less much essentially slightly etc may be viewed as an operator which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand for example in the case of the composite term very tall man the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man to represent a hedge as an operator it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition in this way an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation intersection concentration dilation contrast intensification fuzzification accentuation etc two categories of hedges are considered in the case of hedges of type i e g very much more or less slightly etc the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set in the case of hedges of type ii e g technically essentially practically etc the effect of the hedge is more complicated requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified if in addition the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand then the hedge is said to be of type ip or iip depending on whether it falls into category i or ii the approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very more or less much slightly etc more complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context dependent require the use of a fuzzy algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper,
745,746.0,subject indexes and automatic document retrieval transformations  language  index entries from the subject indexes to ca can in general be converted to normal or title like phrases by applying simple tests to the positions of prepositions and conjunctions in the entries other more complex entries can be transformed after somewhat deeper analysis these manipulations are a necessary preliminary step to the use of the subject index language in retrieval,
746,747.0,the law of constant citation for scientific literature gomperts  in listing the literature concerning the subject of vibrating plates the following law was noticed rj x aj t constant 5x6 where rj is the citation factor for the year j and aj t stands for the total number of articles that have appeared up to and including year j this citation law is based on the remarkable fact that in more than 150 years the mean number of relevant citations per article per year has remained constant viz 2x8 in spite of the fact that after 1950 three times as many articles have been published as in the period before 1950,
747,748.0,the derivation and application of the bradford zipf distribution brookes  any statistical regularities found in documentation should be fully exploited to produce estimates or predictions and to save documentalists work but present formulations of the bradford distribution demand penetrating search for peripheral papers and tedious computation in application the present paper shows that the bradford distribution is closely related to the zipf distribution it requires data on only the most productive journals is mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of the completeness of a search is accepted for comparability of results certain conditions which include a specified minimum level of productivity of journals need to be standardized a standard form is suggested it is found however that a modified form of the bradford distribution is required when bradford type collections of journals are merged into large collections when saturation of the most productive journals occurs,
748,749.0,statistical bibliography or bibliometrics pritchard  the term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by e wyndham hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the sandars reader in bibliography at the university of cambridge subsequently the lectures were published as a book although the debt has never been explicitly recognized by means of citations hulme anticipated modern work on the history of science he used the term to mean the illumination of the processes of science and technology by means of counting documents hulme both summarized the results of cole and eales and produced original work on the growth of uk patents relating these to social progress in the uk and on the changes displayed in the international catalogue of scientific literature relating changes in subject and country production of literature to international developments,
749,750.0,the effect of growth on the obsolescence of semiconductor physics literature oliver  semiconductor physics literature is studied in order to investigate recent hypotheses relating obsolescence to the growth in periodical literature and the growth in the number of contributing scientists the results indicate that obsolescence remains constant and that the two growth rates are within experimental error of equal magnitude for this subject over a five year period these results are seen to be inconsistent with the assumption that an exponentially growing literature possesses a constant utility,
750,751.0,the ambiguity of bradford s law wilkinson  recent discussion of bradford s law of scatter has been founded on two formulations that are not mathematically equivalent a method of comparing the two formulations against empirical data is developed and the results using four sets of existing data are discussed the results show that one particular formulation is more consistent with the practical situation,
751,752.0,on the inverse relationship of recall and precision cleverdon  it is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented which appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverse relationship between recall and precision the idea of this was certainly not new fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on obna and abno systems i e only but not all high precision and all but not only high recall however it was one of the propositions arising from cranfield i which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked in reply to the critical review by swanson i had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification by the following year test results coming from the experiments by salton and from cranfield ii made further modification necessary and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows within a single system assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision and the requirements are those stated in the question there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision if the results of a number of different searches are averaged this it will be noted has four qualifications to the basic statement,
752,753.0,source of citations and references for analysis purposes a comparative assessment brittain  the uses to which analysis of bibliographical references and citations can be put are categorized five sources of references and citations are identified and their advantages and disadvantages for various purposes assessed and compared comparative studies of different sources are urged,
753,754.0,a test for the separation of relevant and non relevant documents in experimental retrieval collections jones  many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving performance taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a baseline the fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little or no effect on particular collections is puzzling this may be due to the initially poor separation of relevant and non relevant documents the paper presents a procedure for characterizing this separation for the collection which can be used to show whether proposed modifications of the base system are likely to be useful,
754,755.0,the journal of documentation bhattacharyya  this paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative tests regarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subject fields it suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural language with particular reference to terminology as used in the different branches of basic science the criteria for defining the terminological consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for determining the degree of terminological consistency the terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such as chemistry physics botany zoology and geology the circumstances in which terms originate and the efforts made by the international scientific community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines are examined in detail this investigation shows why and how an artificially created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current developments and thus points to the source of natural language,
755,756.0,optimization of library expenditure on biochemical journals line  in a 1973 paper sengupta analysed references to biochemical journals in an attempt to provide a guide for librarians with a limited budget he not only ranked journals by the absolute number of citations made to 1969 volumes but related the number of citations to the number of papers and even to the number of words in each journal as perhaps a better guide to selection of journals for subscription than position in the ranking list a similar procedure is adopted in two more recent articles by sengupta on physiology and microbiology journals,
756,757.0,citation analyses as indicators of the use of serials a comparison of ranked title lists produced by citation counting and from use data scales  lists of journals ranked according to number of citations received are frequently used as indicators of usefulness but little research has been carried out to test the validity of this hypothesis on comparing lists of titles of journals ranked by citation counting with lists of the same journals ranked according to frequency of use using data from a survey at the national lending library it was found that the rank order correlation between the two was low this suggestions that ranked lists produced by analyses of citations do not constitute valid guides for journal selection by libraries,
757,758.0,a scientific theory of classification and indexing and its practical application farradane  a classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge from a discussion of the nature of truth it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true the method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms called isolates and the relations between them called operators it is shown that only four basic operators exist expressing appurtenance equivalence reaction and causation using symbols for these operators all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet with the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets formed according to simple rules alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete logical subject index examples are given and possible difficulties are considered a classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations arranged in hierarchical form the nature of possible classifications is discussed it is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data with complete flexibility,
758,759.0,a new look at reference scattering cole  it was first observed by bradford that for a large collection of journal references on a given subject most of the articles are derived from a small proportion of the total titles bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced he obtained a straight line similar results have been obtained by many later workers the pattern is illustrated by table i which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry on the basis of these results bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering vickery later pointed out that this law of scattering predicted not a straight line but a curve kendall has now provided a more refined statistical explanation of the straight line observed by bradford,
759,760.0,the foreign language problem facing scientists and technologists in the united kingdom report of a recent survey wood  the foreign language barrier facing british scientists is a function of a the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced b the linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it and c the availability and effectiveness of translation services to obtain quantitative data on these points the nll has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and librarians in the united kingdom and the present paper presents the more important results the survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists the languages creating the most difficulty are russian german and japanese it has also indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and that as far as national facilities are concerned british scientists are largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their difficulties the results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which the appropriate authorities might follow the most important would seem to be the publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within the united kingdom of a centralized japanese translation service,
760,761.0,minimum vocabularies in information indexing moss  words have no precision though in information storage and retrieval we are required to act as if they did we have therefore to impose certain arbitrary conditions to reduce the element of personal interpretation meaning must be remove from the indexing stage to that of vocabulary construction vocabularies can be reduced to a minimum first to a core of terms used in specialist science and following russel ultimately to undefined terms symbolic of sense experience basic english has shown similar minimizing to be feasible for a natural language the success of batten cards shown that the principle could be equally applicable to specialist indexing vocabularies,
761,762.0,opening the black box of relevance katter  the purpose of this project was to identify variables thought to affect relevance judgements and conduct a series of laboratory studies to determine the effects of these variables on relevance judgements this paper discusses the variable of implicit use orientations the particular attitude taken by a subject judge about the intended use of a document one hundred and forty judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements the some judges then repeated the ratings each adopting assuming one of the fourteen use orientations described to them it was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements it was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system this judgements have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to critical scrutiny there is reason to believe however that as ordinarily obtained they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation studies,
762,763.0,current awareness needs of physicists results of an anglo american study slater  an outline of methods and summary of findings of a study of american british and overseas physicists this project was conducted by aslib research department acting for the institution of electrical engineers and the american institute of physics it took place in 1966 the first year of publication of current papers in physics aims were to assess the need for and reactions to this new current awareness journal and suggestions for improvement and to obtain background information on the current awareness requirements of the physics community,
763,764.0,progress in documentation line  sandison  the term obsolescence occurs frequently in the literature of librarianship and information science in numerous papers we are told how most published literature becomes obsolete within a measurable time and that an item receives half the uses it will ever receive half life in a few years obsolescence is however very rarely defined and its validity interest and practical value are often assumed rather than explained before reviewing studies on obsolescence therefore it is necessary to look at the concept and to identify the reasons why it should be of interest,
764,765.0,bradford s law of scattering vickery  these authors collected a large number of references to a certain subject and arranged the periodicals in which the references occurred in order of decreasing productivity thus for applied geophysics they found loc cit p 112 1 periodical containing 93 references 1 containing 86 4 containing 16 49 containing 2 and 169 containing only 1 reference they then made cumulative totals for the two sets of figures so that in the t most productive periodicals there occurred in all r references bradford then plotted log t against r and his curves are reproduced as b and c in fig 1 an exactly similar procedure for periodical references borrowed by butterwick resulted in curve a in both a and b after an initial steep rise up to about r 500 the curves approximate to a straight line r a log t b,
765,766.0,a national loan policy for scientific serials urquhart  bunn  elsewhere 1 a survey has been reported of the use of the serials in the science museum library in brief this showed that where the science museum library s copy of a serial was frequently used this serial was widely held and that the converse was true in fact it appears that the use of the science museum s copy of a periodical is a rough measure of the national loan use of library copies,
766,767.0,journal usage versus age of journal cole  the effective planning of technical libraries would be greatly facilitated if there were some theoretical basis which could be used to predict the probable distribution by titles and by age of journal of future journal demand as a first step the author has recently developed a general expression for the distribution among journal titles of large groups of journal references in this present paper a relationship between usage and age of journal is established and the application of this relationship to some library planning problems is illustrated,
767,768.0,student attitudes to the university library a survey at southampton university line  a good deal is now known about the use made by students of university libraries notably from the surveys carried out by leeds university library in 1957 and 1960 statistics of use however will not by themselves indicate how good a library is whether as a bookstock a building or an administrative department how adequate is the bookstock how fully is it being exploited how important are physical and personal elements these are questions librarians are continually asking themselves but they are also questions readers could be asked directly or indirectly,
768,769.0,keywords and clumps needham  jones  recent work at the cambridge language research unit has been concerned with the development of automatic classification procedures for information retrieval this has taken the form of research into methods of classification of keywords extracted from documents with a view to using the classes found for co ordinate indexing of technical material we cannot claim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale we have however made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line of research,
769,770.0,tests on abstracts journals martyn  slater  the amount of scientific and technical information published annually in the form of journal articles conference papers reports theses patents and books now greatly exceeds in every field of interest the amount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completely up to date in his own subject for a scientist wishing to inform himself of new developments in neighbouring subject fields the problem is even greater consequently either the scientist reconciles himself to the knowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field or he places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as are available to guide him towards the relevant literature first among such tools is the abstracts journal,
770,771.0,survey of information needs of physicists and chemists aims  scientific research is expensive and the practical application of its results is even more expensive information services are relatively inexpensive and by constantly improving their scope and efficiency and encouraging the scientist to make the best use of them we can minimize duplication and inefficiency in research and development this is the justification for the present survey and for all the work on user needs which has preceded it,
771,772.0,information use studies part 2 comparison of some recent surveys barnes  information use studies are vitally necessary in order to complement challenge and sharpen informed intuitive judgements but even the broadest conclusions drawn from such studies need to be examined critically the conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by special conditions in the survey sample by the environment having been disturbed by the survey by the interpretation given to questions or observations or by the way the data has been analyzed these same factors make direct comparison of results from different surveys difficult and make superficial comparisons misleading some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much less sound than the casual reader might suppose particularly when results have been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey the difficulty of comparing information use surveys is well illustrated by the copious footnotes used by menzel lieberman and dulchin in order to qualify the significance of the results which they compare,
772,773.0,a computer aided information service for nuclear science and technology rolling  the computerized information centre of the european atomic energy community has become operational a survey of its principal characteristics is given and the main problems that arose in the development phase of the system are discussed the euratom thesaurus includes graphic representation of relationships between indexing terms a dual vocabulary allows specific indexing for high relevance and generic indexing for high recall retrieval strategy involves utilization of boolean operators and frequency of occurrence tables recall ration can be determined graphically by a continuous approach method indexing consistency tests show that it pays to use subject specialists user s needs are discussed in terms of subject coverage specificity rapidity and presentation the user service comprises retrospective searches on request as well as customer profile service on subscription there are three types of relevance and various ways of bringing system relevance to coincide with user relevance the centre s budgetary requirements are low due to circumspect use of its computer an ibm 360 model 40 its aims are centralization of documentation in the nuclear field and international co operation,
773,774.0,student attitudes to the university library a second survey at southampton university tidmarsh  in may 1965 a survey into student attitudes to the library of southampton university was carried out by questionnaire with a sample of 322 undergraduates the aim was to assess the effect if any of the considerable measures taken since the 1962 survey uncontrolled factors mainly related to the rapid expansion of the university may however have effected the results it appears that except for social science students there were few improvements in attitudes and use and that seminars had little measurable effect possible explanations for this are offered and the place of reader services in a university library discussed other items covered by the survey include the use of libraries in halls of resinence and of southampton public libraries which in both cases showed a sharp decline since 1962 the number and cost of books bought by undergraduates and their use of libraries in vacations,
774,775.0,the citation characteristics of astronomical research literature meadows  the citation characteristic of papers in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society especially for the years 1963 5 have been examined as a means of studying the usage of astronomical literature in the united kingdom the decrease of usage with age has been investigated and the decay half life determined particular attention has been paid to the immediacy affect and to its possible variation in different sub fields of astronomy the citations have also been separated according to journal of origin as a result of this study a quantitative estimate has been made of the titles and backruns that are required to satisfy a given percentage of the demand for astronomical research literature in the country,
775,776.0,tests on abstracts journals coverage overlap and indexing martyn  in a previous paper j doc 20 4 1964 212 35 a series of tests on the coverage overlap and indexing of abstracts journals were described briefly these were carried out by selecting recent comprehensive bibliographies on specific subjects searching the appropriate abstracts journals via the author indexes to determine the number of references given in the bibliography that were abstracted then consulting the subject indexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been abstracted a further eight bibliographies have been studied and the results are reported here our results are presented below in the following form 1 title of bibliography source content number of journal references reports etc 2 abstracts journals consulted 3 coverage and multiple coverage this is a bar chart showing number of references not abstracted those covered once twice and so on 4 coverage by each abstracts journal given as a bar chart the last column showing coverage by all services combined where bar charts are given they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography actual numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns 5 taking each abstracts journal separately we show the headings under which references were found in the subject index some references we were unable to locate so there is often an apparent discrepancy with the figures given in 4,
776,777.0,estimates of the number of currently available scientific and technical periodicals barr  published estimates of the number of scientific and technical periodicals currently being published are analyzed a new estimates is put forward based on the experience of the nll in attempting to build up a comprehensive collection of the world s scientific and technical periodical literature,
777,778.0,the bradford distribution leimkuhler  the distribution of references in a collection of pertinent source documents can be described and predicted by the relation f x ln 1 bx ln 1 b where the parameter b is related to the subject field and the completeness of the collection the model is used to predict the reference yield of abstracting journals in a search for thermophysical property data it is used also to explain differences among various literature studies of the past in terms of differences in subject and comprehensiveness of search the model is derived from s c bradford s law of scattering and is called the bradford distribution,
778,779.0,evaluating the economic efficiency of a document retrieval system climenson  a retrieval system may be evaluated strictly in terms of user satisfaction operating efficiency or it may be evaluated from the point of view of efficient means of satisfying user requirements economic efficiency when we consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic efficiency we are faced with a whole series of possible trade offs there may be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs the problem is to determine the most economical path to follow pay off factors break even points and diminishing returns must be taken into consideration this paper considers some of these factors in relation to various parts of the complete retrieval system the acquisition subsystem the indexing subsystem the index language the searching subsystem and the equipment subsystem,
779,780.0,the measures of information retrieval effectiveness proposed by swets brookes  objective comparisons of the effectiveness of ir techniques are needed for development of ir systems the measures proposed by swets which offer important advantages are analyzed and critically discussed modifications of the swets measures designed to increase their generality and to facilitate their interpretation in terms of system variables are proposed,
780,781.0,a study of cross referencing tagliacozzo  the problem of determining the optimal cross reference structure for a given index and for a given community of users is discussed a ross reference structure is represented as a graph in which the nodes are index terms and the links are relations between index terms in order to clarify the concept of level of cross referencing the characteristics of cross referencing structure are studied some measures of cross reference distributions are suggested as a means of comparing the cross referencing levels of subject indexes types of relations linking the terms of cross references in existing indexes and thesauri are examined the implications of the study for the construction and testing on indexes and thesauri are discussed,
781,782.0,statistics of scientific and technical articles vickery  a new estimate of the number of currently published scientific and technical periodicals has been put forward by k p barr of the national lending library it may be of interest to supplement this with some figures on the number and distribution of articles within these periodicals these figures are derived from a survey undertaken at the nll early in 1964,
782,783.0,author versus title a comparative survey of the accuracy of the information which the user brings to the library catalogue searle  details are given of a survey carried out in a large scientific special library on the comparative accuracy of the author and title information which the user brings to the catalogue the sample was restricted to requests for book material the results are analyzed in detail and show the title to be more accurate some suggestions are made for extending this type of survey,
783,784.0,documentation notes cawkell  i would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number of references per article firstly on average articles more than fifteen years old rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance the net increase per annum of citeable articles is not as large as might otherwise be expected secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas each tending to have its own literature and internal citation practices are hiving off from the classical areas because of the specialized nature of modern science thirdly it seems that the building blocks of an article can on average be adequately specified regardless of the volume of published information by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main theme associated concepts and methods and general background,
784,785.0,the parametric description of retrieval tests part i the basic parameters robertson  some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests on ir systems are analysed several considerations outside the score of the usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters in particular a variable which produces a performance curve of a system corresponds to an extension of the 2x2 table also the statistical relationships between parameters are all important it is considered that precision is not such a useful measure of performance in conjunction with recall as fallout a more powerful alternative to cleverdon s inevitable inverse relationship between recall and precision is proposed and justified namely that the recall fallout graph is convex,
785,786.0,documentation notes zipf  a recent article by kozachkov and khursin entitled the basic probability distribution in information flow systems describes the fundamental similarity of a number of known statistical regularities in the flow of information they propose a basic model called the hyperbolic ladder and relate it in particular to work in linguistics by zipf in documentation by bradford and in the science of science by lotka the purpose of this note is to speculate further on the relevance of zipf s law in librarianship,
786,787.0,the complete bradford zipf bibliograph brookes  this technical note summarizes the outcome of recent analyses of empirical data which have enabled the general form of the bradford zipf distribution to be elucidated,
787,788.0,the use of social science periodical literature bower  the paper presents the results of a survey of the use of social science periodicals carried out at the national lending library during a period of four weeks in 1968 three quarters of the requests came from universities and industrial organizations and over 90 of the requests were for english language publications over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles there were marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types of organizations and although the overall half life of the literature proved to be 3 1 2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another concerning the sources of references it was discovered that compared with scientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use of abstracting and indexing publications appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey a list of title requested six or more times and a list of abstracting and indexing publications cited five or more times as sources of references,
788,789.0,social science literature use in the uk as indicated by citations vickery  a sample of citations made in 1965 united kingdom social science literature has been analyzed according to subject bibliographic form country of origin language and date and comparisons made with citations from science and technology literature the relative size of the outputs of and demands for literature in these fields are estimated and the subject distribution of citation within social science the interrelations between source and cited subject are discussed use as indicated by citation is compared with use measured by loan demand on the national lending library,
789,790.0,computer indexing of medical articles project medico artandi  an automatic indexing method is described in which index tags for documents are generated by the computer the computer scans the text of periodical articles and automatically assigns to them index terms with their respective weights on the basis of explicitly defined text characteristics a machine file of document references with their associated index terms is automatically produced which can be searched on a co ordinate basis for the retrieval of specified drug related information,
790,791.0,progress in documentation empirical hyperbolic distributions bradford zipf mandelbrot for bibliometric description and prediction fairthorne  since 1960 and especially during the past three years many papers have appeared about particular manifestations and applications of a certain class of empirical laws to a field that may be labelled conveniently bibliometrics this term resuscitated by alan pritchard see page 348 denotes in my paraphrase quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded discourse and behaviour appertaining to it in this field the law cited is usually that named after bradford or zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical literature or physical access in the rate of diminishing returns or in the cumulative yield from a given input the behaviour is hyperbolic that is the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant this type of behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from meteorology to economics and has given rise to many particular explanations appropriate to the particular fields thus it has received many names according to its exponents in both senses of that word,
791,792.0,photocopies v periodicals cost effectiveness in the special library brookes  evidence provided by the dainton report indicates that special libraries in the uk are far from fully exploiting the photocopying services provided by the national libraries as these photocopying services are legally obliged to operate at cost they offer significant economies to any special library which exploits them systematically this paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings that can be made or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at no additional cost by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the peripheral periodicals relating to any well defined scientific or technical subject though photocopying charges must be realistic the confident exploitation of the national photocopying services depends on the avoidance of arbitrary jumps in photocopying charges,
792,793.0,the half life of periodical literature apparent and real obsolescence line  the expression half life borrowed from physics has appeared quite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960 when an article by burton and kebler on the half life of some scientific and technical literatures was published although it had certainly been used previously burton and kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than disintegrating as in its original meaning so that half life means half the active life and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during which one half of the currently active literature was published numerous studies have been carried out mainly by the analysis of citations to establish obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects bourne points out that different studies have given widely different results so that many of the half life figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of literature or users surveyed certainly they cannot be used as accurate measures for discriminating between different subject fields,
793,794.0,half life vickery  the first diagram below gives a schematic view of a subject literature that is growing exponentially with time the number of items published per year doubles in five years each square of the paper represents a published item the marks on the diagram represent current uses of the literature say citations made or items borrowed this year the inked squares are actual uses the dots are hypothetical uses those that would occur if every published item had an equal chance of being used in fact every fifth item is dotted,
794,795.0,progress in documentation cleverdon  thirty years or more ago a favoured question in examination papers for librarians was some variation on the theme compare the merits of a classified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue this was a subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits without ever stating a single demonstratable fact when in the early 1950 s various people such as taube and mooers proposed new techniques for indexing the reaction from the traditionally minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments in an editorial in american documentation in 1955 perry expressed a viewpoint shared by many others when he wrote cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems may the age old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future there is hope for the avoidance of such errors if we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices the benefits of which must be determined not by polemics but by the intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and costs the machines of the future can make us free but only if we are willing to subject them and ourselves to the most rigid intellectual discipline,
795,796.0,switching languages for indexing coates  the paper describes some properties of simple interconversion devices which enable material initially subject indexed by a particular indexing system to be made available to other institutions using different indexing languages in such a form as to be readily integrated into their indexes reference is made to the outline intermediate lexicon which is the germinal form of a switching language for the field of information science difficulties and problems in effecting satisfactory information transfer through such an interconversion scheme are explored and suggestions made for the lines upon which further research needs to be undertaken the author was the classification research group representative on the international working party concerned with the intermediate lexicon,
796,797.0,progress in documentation mills  classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that care is needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application such as information retrieval retrieval from an information store a library of those items relevant to a request involves locating a particular class describing what we think we want and then if necessary adjusting this class broadening it to find more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive this implies recognition of the relations between the classes and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as locating and relating assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents those most likely to be relevant the operation is entirely one of classification the recognition of particular classes and their relations the fact that the instrument we use to assist this operation may display quasi classificatory features e g alphabetical sequence or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact,
797,798.0,the thesaurofacet a multipurpose retrieval language tool aitchison  a description is given of the english electric thesaurofacet a faceted classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific technical and management subjects a novel feature of the system is the integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus each term appears both in the thesaurus and in the schedules in the schedules the term is displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy the thesaurus supplements this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships which cut across the classified arrangement the thesaurus also controls word forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers the resulting tool is multipurpose as easily applicable to shelf arrangement and conventional classified card catalogues as to co ordinate indexing and computerized retrieval systems the reasons are given for modifying certain traditional facet techniques including the choice of traditional disciplines for main classes the lack of a built in preferred order and the use in certain instances of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi term concepts methods of application of the thesaurofacet in pre coordinate and post coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the techniques employed in its compilation,
798,799.0,access and recognition from user s data to cataloque entries kochen  patterns of searching in library catalogues were analysed using the data from a large survey of the use of three university library and one public library catalogues known item searches were the object of the study success or failure of the search was correlated to degree of correctness and completeness of the searcher s information about title and author of the item that he wished to locate factors involved in searching strategies were discussed the double role played by both the title and the author as a way of access to the catalogue and as a means for identifying the right entry was examined,
799,800.0,the growth utility and obsolescence of scientific periodical literature brookes  line s recently proposed technique for correcting the apparent half life to allow for the rate of growth of the literature and vickery s critical analysis of the proposal are both further analyzed using the concept of utility and considering the sampling variances involved the paper shows that line s technique is both questionable and impractical and that a further factor the growth of the number of contributors needs to be allowed for in vickery s analysis a collaborative empirical investigation is proposed,
800,801.0,udc user profiles as developed for a computer based sdi service in the iron and steel industry carmichael  extension of the selective dissemination of information system required the adoption of computer based techniques the indexing language adopted is udc and it was necessary to construct user profiles based on the classification profiles have been compiled for individual clients of the service for works within the british steel corporation and for broad fields of activity within the iron and steel industry use of the service has shown that udc provides a satisfactory basis for profile compilation the majority of profiles so far constructed have relevance of over 95 based on user assessment possible future developments in the compilation of the profiles are considered,
801,802.0,feasibility study of a scheme for reconciling thesauri covering a common subject neville  the feasibility is examined of devising a scheme for operating a joint keyword system in a given subject area using several independently compiled thesauri it is suggested that if the individual keywords of each participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts and these concepts are given unique code numbers then the code numbers enable the keywords of any participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any other participant incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from differences in the selection and form of keywords eleven types of incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for each the types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include those that arise between one language and another so that a multilingual joint system presents no additional problems,
802,803.0,progress in documentation foskett  the term informatics was first advanced formally by the director of viniti a i mikhailov and his colleagues a i chernyi and r s gilyarevskii in their paper informatics new name for the theory of scientific information published at the end of 1966 an english translation was circularized in the beginning of 1967 as the authors state in this paper they are not the first to use this term and they quote a review by professor j g dorfmann of their own book fundamentals of scientific information in which dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology such as documentation documentalistics information science and so on their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information only the structure and properties in their paper they also advance definitions for information scientific information scientific information activity information officer and information scientist they have backed up their proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition and the title of the information science fascicule of the referativnyi zhurnal which is now called informatiki,
803,804.0,several law relations in science bibliography a self consistent interpretation naranan  several power law relations are found to occur in bibliographic studies of scientific journals articles and citations these can be interpreted in a self consistent manner in terms of growth parameters of articles journals and citations similar models have been proposed earlier in physical biological and behavioral sciences,
804,805.0,automatic indexing using bibliographic citations salton  bibliographic citations attached to technical documents have been used variously to refer to related items in the literature to confer importance to a given piece of writing and to serve as supplementary indications of document content in the present study citations are used directly to identify document content and an attempt is made to evaluate their effectiveness in a retrieval environment it is shown that the use of bibliographic citations in addition to the normal keyword type indicators produces improved retrieval performance and that in some circumstances citations are more effective for retrieval purposes than other more conventional terms and concepts,
805,806.0,the extension on users literature awareness as a measure of retrieval performance and its application to medlars miller  the performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each of a number of queries a suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the recall ratio the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the system when the file is large this method of measuring performance is not practicable and recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated a number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory another measure of retrieval performance is the extension ratio which is approximately the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting a query to the retrieval system the properties of this measure are examined and it is applied to 315 medlars searches,
806,807.0,free text word retrieval and scientist indexing performance profile and costs carlson  comparative performance profiles were determined by two independent scientific information centres for on line retrieval by means of a free text words and b subject indexing codes from a data base of 4 600 descriptions of in going research projects in four broad subject areas altogether thirty nine questions that users had previously asked of the science information exchange sie of the smithsonian institution and that were in the four subjects areas were employed by sie staff scientists and twelve of these were independently used by staff members of the biological science communication project bscp of the george washington university results of the two studies showed average recall values 30 40 higher and relevance values 15 20 higher for subject index code use as compared with text word use advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are discussed,
807,808.0,the use of older literature and its obsolescence sandison  terminalogy and parameters for describing the relation between figures for the use of library literature and for its age are discussed unless a correction for growth is applied half life fails a simple test of suitability as do brookes s aging and utility factors results based on cumulated data have other important disadvantages relative use per item figures are satisfactory the need to relate terminology more closely to the facts they represent is stressed item consultation decay rate and 50 consultation probability age are suggested and defined in the context of citation studies item citation decay rate and 50 citation probability age are equivalent and avoid similar objections in data from nrlsi item consultation decay rates are only approximately exponential different rates are demonstrated for updating and basic searches for academic and other types of readers and for types of literature for some historical searches negative decay rates were found in the nrlsi and bml,
808,809.0,a single computer based system for both current awareness and retrospective search operating experience with assassin bramwell  assassin as designed and operated by ici agricultural division provides from a single paper tape input a current awareness service by sdi and a retrospective search both by a weighted term machine search and printed kwoc type indexes programs for producing structured thesauri are part of the package input is in the form of abstracts from both published and internal source the system has operated for more than a year at the agricultural division and is currently in use at five other locations flexibility of the package is demonstrated by the variety of applications this paper outlines the various applications and shows how a single package may be used complete or in part or with modification machine costs are given for the major application the system was designed with the possible input of externally produced machine readable data in mind the intended application of the package in conjunction with tapes such as those of the institute for scientific information source and chemical abstracts condensates is outlined,
809,810.0,a probabilistic search strategy for medlars miller  one technique for searching a co ordinate index is to compare each reference with a boolean expression of index terms this divides the file into retrieved and not retrieved references an alternative is to assign each reference score calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the n highest scoring references in the file this scoring technique has several advantages in theory and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with n equal to the number of references retrieved by the corresponding boolean search in the test a minimum value of n 10 was used and when less then this number of references matched the boolean search requirement the scoring technique successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the boolean searches,
810,811.0,measuring readers failure at the shelf schofield  this paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by the library it outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the non availability of books which they are looking for the survey has already been installed at four university libraries but the results from only one library are considered here these results show how a librarian can find out the degree of non availability or failure in any particular area of the library the causes of failure and even the particular items which are in heavy demand and not available they also provide information on the degree of co operation by the readers the number of titles failing once twice three times etc the overlap of demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers the waiting time for books that failed the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of time the relationship between failure and recall the correlation of failure from one term to the next and the relative use of books inside and outside the library from the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library procedure which should have reduced failure and to compare the titles of books failing in the main library with the holdings of a departmental library the time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given,
811,812.0,a statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval sparck jones  the exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent it is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically as a function of term use rather than of term meaning the effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently occurring terms are required for good overall performance it is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency so that matches on less frequent more specific terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure,
812,813.0,comparative efficiency of searching titles abstracts and terms in a free text data base wyatt  the choice of the suitable data base for providing an information service is governed by factors of coverage performance and cost the cost of the data base to subscribers is a known quantity and the coverage is decided by the data base producers this paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of the four major chemical abstracts service magnetic tape data base chemical titles ct which contains the titles of citations only chemical abstracts condensates cac which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases chemical biological activities cbac and polymer science and technology post both of which contain full digests in addition to titles the performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four data bases on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used in the experiment search profiles corresponding to these questions were constructed for searching against each database output was assessed for relevance by users and profile performance figures precision and recall ratios were calculated for each profile the overall retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against data bases containing titles only titles plus keywords and titles plus digests was calculated and these results are presented,
813,814.0,towards automatic profile construction barker  veal  wyatt  this paper describes part of the chemical abstracts condensate evaluation cac evaluation carried out by the united kingdom chemical information service ukcis the work described was designed to test the feasibility of using automatic or semi automatic methods to replace or reduce the intellectual effort involved in retrieving information from machine readable stores particularly those using natural language,
814,815.0,standard times for information systems a method for data collection and analysis robertson  with a view of obtaining a set of standard times for information system operations aslib research department is developing and testing methods for collecting and analyzing data on the time taken to perform certain operations the current state of development of these methods is described data collection is by a self recording diary method completed at the time of performing the operation the major problem is one of identifying describing and analyzing the effect of the various factors which might affect the time first results indicate that it is possible to explain a large proportion of the variations in individual times by taking account of a sufficient number of variables,
815,816.0,measuring readers failure at the shelf in three university libraries schofield  this paper continues the reporting of the unit s work on a method of investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the shelves why they fail and what particular books they fail to find the method used is a slight modification of the earlier one readers were asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they were looking for or subject area they were looking in their academic status and the date and then to place the slip in an adjoining box fron analysis of these failure slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader s failure the individual book the reader was looking for and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes a new development was surveys of samples of readers carried out during the fortnight of peak demand answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader s work what action he took after failing whether he found adequate substitutes how many books he found by browsing and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in and borrowed from the library the investigations were carried out in three university libraries each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns these differences were reflected in the results obtained it is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own libraries,
816,817.0,the aberrystwyth index languages test keen  reports a laboratory comparision of the effectiveness and efficiency of five index languages in the subject area of library and information science three post co ordinate languages compressed term uncontrolled and hierarchically structured and two pre co ordinate ones hierarchically structures and relational indexing eight test comparisons were made and factors studied were index language specificity and linkage indexing specificity and exhaustivity method of co ordination the precision devices of partitioning and relational operators and the provision of context in the search file full details of the test and retrieval results are presented,
817,818.0,progress in documentation research in user behaviour in university libraries ford  the task of the librarian is to achieve his library s objectives a simplistic statement perhaps but it is rare that a library s objectives are defined in any terms other than the broadest for example to meet the needs of its users in fact the definition of objectives in any service organization is likely to be an iterative process but the explicit commitment to users needs however mystical this concept may be requires the librarian to examine users behaviour as a first step to determining policy since a complete state of the art in user behaviour would fill a substantial book this survey is restricted to drawing together some threads of research of potential application in university libraries methodological problems are not discussed here since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere,
818,819.0,document analysis and linguistic theory gardin  in this presentation i shell be concerned with only one aspect of information science and its relation with linguistics namely document analysis document analysis is here understood in following sense the extraction of meaning of documents in the present case written documents we could define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between scientific literature the object of document analysis in information science and other kinds of texts historical records myths folklore sacred writings etc indeed one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents or questions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in general as carried out in many disciplines history sociology cultural anthropology exegesis etc gardin 1969 for the purpose of this presentation however i shall concentrate on the handling of scientific documents in the first narrower sense and only refer to other categories of texts in so far as they have been submitted to analytical processes of a comparable nature,
819,820.0,studies to compare retrieval using titles with that using index terms sdi from nuclear science abstracts datta  a selective dissemination of information service based on computer scanning of nuclear science abstracts tapes has operated at harwell since october 1968 users interest profiles are constructed using euratom index terms and nsa subject categories assigned to each item in nsa the performance of the mechanized sdi service has been compared with that of the pre existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff the visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision about 85 to a limited number of users the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision approximately 50 but can be expanded more readily in order to compare the effectiveness of euratom index terms and words on titles for computer sdi matching an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed nsa document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories or words in titles and subject categories without being aware of the method of matching over 10 000 document assessments fron six issues of nsa were returned the average precision was 45 6 for index terms and 47 3 for title words index terms retrieved more documents in the ratio 1 13 1 but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other index terms retrieved only 58 of the relevant documents selected by titles the converse ratio was 51 no significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms though with a lower precision a detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other was made to identify reasons for failure,
820,821.0,recent growth of the literature of biochemistry and changes in ranking of periodicals sengupta  the ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s as a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study the consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject to cope with this unprecedented growth of literature a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the annual review of biochemistry for 1968 1969 and 1970 this list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by henkle in 1938 the present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies a method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study the analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published compactness of the information content and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation the results of the present study have been discussed in relation to bradford s law of scattering and an extension of the law has been suggested namely that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field it is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research,

893,894.0,an experiment in index term frequency svenonius  this paper presents an experimental study of index term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance the frequency of an index term or its breadth as it is called here is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection the question is asked of index terms assigned to documents which function most effectively in retrieval the most term or popular terms or those which are used relatively infrequently the experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the cranfield salton data breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents retrieval output is evaluated using the expected search length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall the wilcoxen test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings the results show that the optimal breadth of indexing is a variable depending on user needs if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones if on the other hand all or most relevant documents are wanted then broad terms are better an argument however can be made for the quality of narrow terms since when these terms are deleted precision never improves whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision a corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms terms taken from the document title and the other consists of merely reasonable index terms the result suggest that title term indexing is qualifiedly superior,

925,926.0,the lending of books to one another by libraries green  it would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time it happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader or that in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book which he finds in the catalogue of another library but which does not belong to his own collection the book very likely is one that can be replaced if lost but it would take time to get it through ordinary channels it might be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one if the book is scarce in such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to borrow a book for a few days,

928,929.0,the trading stamp mentality stokes  a number of trips to the united states to teach in library schools have inculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of american library education they are personal opinions no more but they come from one who has seen much that he admires and who believes wholeheartedly that the american spirit includes a firm resolution to change whatever is inefficient or corrupt otherwise 1776 would have no meaning the opinions do not stem directly from my experience in the five accredited schools in which i have taught but are strongly rooted in my general observation of library education practice and my discussions with members of the library profession,

931,932.0,the urban library dilemma gaines  the american urban public library is in something of a dilemma relatively secure in the affections of the populace the library is nevertheless frequently threatened by loss of income the threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture which at the present time is notably obscure the abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in newark and new york received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable in the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather in 12 years in two city libraries i have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library i think the experience is not uncommon only the most extraordinary efforts keep most urban libraries from going under libraries seldom thrive they survive periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic success the paradox invites some critical self analysis,
932,933.0,the library press moon  the deadliest disease afflicting the library press is proliferation the kindest and most conservative estimate i am able to bring myself to make is that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country as we can afford or are necessary perhaps the most constructive single thing that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three publishers of a library periodical to cease publication one might reasonably expect that librarians who have done so much public wailing about the publication explosion would be among the chief advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print instead we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king size bed of printed procreation as do the denizens of the sodom and gomorrah of science and technology just about every library of any consequence and some of little consequence and almost without exception every group or organization within the loose boundaries of our profession decides virtually at the moment of its birth that it cannot survive without a publication of its own a newsletter a journal some regular calling card to announce its presence to the world at large,
933,934.0,library education and the public library garrison  a major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains for current service instead of educating for growth and change unfortunately the picture many faculty members have of what today s requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete graduates are thus doubly handicapped not only do we fail to educate we fail even to provide realistic training at worst we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries library education like the public library itself will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive others will wither away disappear or be replaced by more responsive agencies there is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both an article in the june 13 1968 issue of the reporter called dust gathers on the public library summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and loss of purpose of a once revered institution however the reporter is dead while the public library lives on,
934,935.0,crisis in library education bundy  a battle is currently being waged at the university of maryland school of library and information services its outcome will influence the future of the library profession because of the significance of this controversy this situation at maryland is here brought to the attention of the profession at large last fall a group with funding from the office of education brought into being an educational program which is addressing the profession s most critical problems those central to its survival as a viable social institution the library profession s need to define and fulfill an important service function in the public arena its failure to make itself relevant to other than middle class interests in the culture and its inavailability to contribute to the alleviation of the severe social economic and other inequalities which exist in the culture and which continue to deprive black americans particularly of even minimal life opportunities,
935,936.0,along the academic way mason  the invitation to apply for this council on library resources fellowship stated as one aim to break administrators loose from their desk to read investigate and reach for broadening experiences that might make them administrate better the application listed seven targets of study in the working context of university research libraries 1 organizational structures 2 management techniques 3 program budgeting 4 use of machines including the computer 5 research collection development 6 non book materials in the library 7 out of building services,
936,937.0,the philadelphia project benford  the objectives of the research were 1 to determine actual requirements for library resources by elementary and secondary grade students and to evaluate existing library resources in terms both of student needs and national standards and 2 on the basis of this information to outline the respective roles of the school libraries and the public libraries in providing needed resources and in developing joint planning,
937,938.0,library cost analysis a recipe kountz  unforgivably time has passed since the days when the library s patron was the local monarch and cost was no deterrent time s passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders and concurrently sensitivity to cost has attained stellar importance the causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons but they cannot in all fairness to the profession belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost accounting what is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together in short a recipe for cost accounting and analysis in the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years it is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop therefore feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements with regard to discipline it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow in addition to identifying steps requirements and the mysterious ways of cost analysis these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library s future,
938,939.0,the paradoxes of library cooperation dougherty  the need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized as countless articles written within the past decade will attest moreover the necessity to combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today because the cost of self sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive libraries can no longer afford to act as free agents voluntary library cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction rhetoric alone is a impotent agent of change in truth cooperative programs succeed only as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his institution,
939,940.0,isbd its origin rationale and implications spaulding  a proper understanding of the international standard bibliographic description isbd a standard promulgated by the international federation of library associations ifla requires some knowledge of how it came into existence what reasoning prompted its development ad what useful results can be expected from its adoption these matters will be dealt with below hopefully in sufficient detail to provide readers with a basis for teaching a sound evaluation of the effect of this standard when applied to american cataloging practice and in particular to lc cataloging and marc tapes,

941,942.0,pay libraries user charges gennaro  the battle lines are being drawn for a great debate over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library and information services are to be funded in the coming decades most librarians will be on the side of conservatism and democracy favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax supported public library service with information freely available to all as a matter of right information industry people publishers government officials engineers and even perhaps authors will be on the side of progress and profits advocating a new concept of for profit or pay libraries user charges and information as a salable commodity,
942,943.0,austerity technology and resource sharing research libraries face the future gennaro  during the last two decades academic libraries in parallel with their parent institutions experienced the greatest period of growth and affluence that they have ever known the watchword was more more money more books and journals more staff more space and more technology many new research libraries were created and those that already existed experienced unprecedented growth although libraries got more of everything during those years they still could not keep pace with the growth of new fields of research new doctoral programs and the increasing production of books and journals two decades of affluence not only failed to help solve the many problems that were brought on by exponential growth they exacerbated them,
943,944.0,the view from the tower of babel gore  a funny thing happened on the way to the biggest building boom in library history book collections grew faster than the new space to hold them so when the boom was over the aggregate space problem of academic libraries was a little worse than it was at the beginning during the roughly eight year span of the rise and fall of the boom some 570 new or expanded library buildings sprang up on the campuses of four year and graduate institutions around the nation,
944,945.0,a library management game a report on a research project brophy  although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years its origins have been traced to simple war games used in military training when the real thing was either unavailable or too dangerous in more recent times these games have become more and more sophisticated and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved since 1956 when the first well developed management game was introduced the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education from primary school classes to courses for experienced men and women one of the main causes of this game explosion has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques such as simulation and mathematical modelling which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology,
945,946.0,library materials lyman  the problem investigated by the research was the development of standards for reading materials that would support the adult new reader in the exercise of his new found skill and build the habit of regular use of the printed word bridging the gap between minimal literacy skills and the reading habit was proposed as essential to the purposes of the library program in helping the reader improve has basic education skills increase his employability and develop his potential as a citizen and gain personal satisfaction in his many adult roles the nature of library materials best designed for this end required study in depth the findings and conclusions derived from the research project provide basic information about the adult new reader and his reading criteria for analysis of reading materials and a bibliography of materials these products of the study constitute a series of reading selection and guidance aids for use by all persons working in this area of service librarians community workers teachers publishers editors and reading specialists,
946,947.0,library networks goldstein  the combination of computers and communications technology is a development whose time has come for libraries in the u s and despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting the new technology for its use libraries are now rapidly expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to disseminate ever expanding amounts of information in more effective ways it makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library s function is to parcel out information and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed in fact the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon consultants systems analysts state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes xerox and international business machines their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks in particular the cataloging of new acquisitions the ohio college library center for example provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files and because oclc is the first and most extensive of the networks its approach is being closely copied by the others,
947,948.0,library planning and decision making systems hamburg  the research project which produced this book concentrated on the problem of the design and development of statistical information systems that would provide quantitative information for effective management of university and large public libraries since there is an inseparable need not only for improved library statistical data systems but also for the above mentioned frameworks for rational planning and decision making we have devoted considerable effort to the development of analytical models that might assist library administrators in making decisions that would maximize the flow of benefits imparted to the communities the library serves some of the results of this model building effort are repored in these pages,
948,949.0,library practice in hospitals bloomquist  according to a national hospital panel survey conducted by the american hospital association in february 1970 4 191 72 percent of the 5 820 community hospitals in the united states operated a library this percentage falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100 bed capacity are considered 1 990 libraries in 3 318 hospitals in the 4 191 libraries one or more full time staff members were found in only 1 054 25 percent in even fewer 928 was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform properly their functions of health education and patient care by community hospital we mean the nonfederal short term hospital providing general and selected special services the hospital located at some distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research programs such as a nursing school or internships though the librarians of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study of this book it is written primarily for an audience of untrained probably newly employed individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital s library and do not know where to begin,
949,950.0,the crisis in cataloging osborn  a wise german librarian has linked the library administrator and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library s resources this aim he thinks is expressed in various kinds of cooperative work of pooling interests and of setting standards it is to be developed prudently he says with the objectives setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be destroyed than are created this ideal he set out in a chapter entitled tasks for the future there was a time and not so very far back when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side in the more immediate past however the two have become separated so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down as a task for the future the immediate future at that many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator and most catalogers have had more work than enough with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration the situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field,
950,951.0,the historical background of departmental and collegiate libraries thompson  in spite of the great volume of material dealing with departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in library periodicals and books on university and college library administration there has been relatively little original thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to provide an adequate background for solution of problems which have their roots in a former generation most of the literature has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against this type of library organization or statements of how this or that institution has faced its peculiar problems except for contemporary accounts of early american scholars describing the attempts to transplant the german seminar library to american soil and reports on a few large university libraries there is no account of the conditions which brought about and for many years invigorated the departmental system an evaluation of trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last three quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators who are interested in abolishing establishing continuing or amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution,
951,952.0,characteristics of the research literature used by chemists and physicists in the united states fussler  the increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have the processes of cataloging classifying and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive the processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is on the average potentially if not actually higher than that for its predecessor the total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books,
952,953.0,characteristics of the research literature used by chemists and physicists in the united states part ii fussler  this is the second of two papers dealing with the characteristics of the literature used by research chemists and physicists in the united states the method of the study was fully outlined in th first article and will therefore not be repeated here the previous paper was devoted to a discussion of the importance of the literature of various subject fields to research in chemistry and physics the remarks that follow are directed primarily to a discussion of the temporal span of the literature the principal forms of the literature the national origins of the literature used in the united states and some attention is devoted to the more important serial titles,
953,954.0,the librarian from occupation to profession goode  an industrial society has an open class stratification system it offers some an opportunity to rise but it offers no guarantee against downward social mobility compared to other types of societies this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies one which neither marx nor orthodox economists anticipated an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to rise in the class system but occupations too are engaged in the same competition and may move up or down in power prestige or income,
954,955.0,interrelations among special librarys budington  the present paper will first deal with some of the objectives etiology and requirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co operation next in this context of network development a number of activities involving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and example the greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are on the surface at least random and informal we shall therefore concentrate on such arrangements as have about them some measure of structure and intent finally we will deduce from these examples the performance and promise which special libraries may offer to a total library network or information system,
955,956.0,the cranfield ii relevance assessments a critical evaluation harter  the relevance assessments belonging to the cranfield ii document query collection are shown to be faulty in the sense that many relevant documents were not so identified by the cranfield judges the implications of these omissions for the evaluation of information retrieval experiments based on the cranfield collection are examined in detail it is shown that numerical measures of retrieval effectiveness may be greatly altered bu consideration of the missing relevant documents and that a ranking of retrieval methods according to order of performance may vary as well,
956,957.0,an economic analysis of library benefits goddard  libraries find it increasingly necessary to use their limited resources in the most efficient manner this requires the use of decision rules which permit library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest returns an effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society an evaluation of the traditional library functions of education information and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are involved a case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of school age children other explicitly involved in education disadvantages minority groups and governmental officials and staff since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same services it is an uneconomic use of the communities resources to maintain two separate institutions one of which imposes costs on the other as children are forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies,
957,958.0,the review article its characteristics and problems virgo  the characteristics and problems associated with the review literature in the sciences were examined three major classes of review articles were identified 1 the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the contributions made within the previous year 2 the critical review which selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem and 3 data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken the role and control of the review article in medicine was described over the past fifteen years the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has been on the order of 1 38 possible solutions to a number of problems associated with the review literature are discussed such as the selection of articles for review further examination of some critical questions relating to the production and organization of reviews will have to be undertaken before the review as a means of bringing the most significant information to its users will be accepted as a reliable adjunct to the original publications,
958,959.0,measures of library effectiveness morse  mathematical models of library operations are presented allowing managers to estimate measures of effectiveness for a library these models describe the amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit the distribution of book circulation in a collection the dependence of circulation on time and the effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction predictions are made on the basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into branch libraries the effect in terms of frustrated use of removing the least used books from a collection is discussed as are strategies for for duplication the emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models for this purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas,
959,960.0,library operations research a process of discovery and justification leimkuhler  this article begins with a discussion of the broad role of operations research o r in a society undergoing change the nature of o r terms in a library environment is then considered the function of models in o r is analyzed the development of a model being contrasted with its formal presentation criteria for good models are suggested this article then focuses on storage models for libraries first considering the dewey classification system from this perspective and then summarizing more current research carried out under the direction of the author with a grant from the national science foundation,
960,961.0,an operations research study of a variable loan and duplication policy at the university of lancaster buckland  the library research unit of the university of lancaster used an operations research o r approach to recommend changes in loan and duplication policies in the university library the variable loan and duplication policy which was developed is described and also the considerable impact of implementation other libraries are now adopting this kind of policy the work is presented as a case study in library o r the great importance of analyzing the structure of problems is stressed and the nature and usefulness of models is described for the most useful results suitable librarians should be included in the research team,
961,962.0,library objectiveness and performance measures and their use in decision making bommer  for optimal allocations of limited funds it is necessary for libraries to develop measures of output various forms of user exposure to documents are discussed in an effort to develop such measures for public libraries it is suggested that the actual method of accounting be used to compare such measures with costs and an illustrative computation is presented it is shown how size of user population amount of exposure and costs for a given year can be estimated similar techniques are suggested for evaluation of library programs this approach is then compared with current concepts of library standards the paper concludes with suggestions for further research,
962,963.0,catalog use in a large research library lipetz  concern with the questions of when and how best to computerize the catalog of a large research library and how to improve an existing conventional catalog motivated a study of the utilization of the main catalog of the yale university library the study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample of catalog use traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of more than a year a schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed traffic volume by hour of day day of week and time of year more than 1 000 interviews were completed using nonleading interviewing technique information was derived on the catalog user s objective starting clues and university affiliation search success was determined follow up studies were performed on the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches reasons for search failure were determined for know item searches availability and accuracy of different categories of search clues were ascertained published algorithms for searching computerized bibliographic files were evaluated attention is given to the feasibility of automatic construction of computerized catalogs some of the available results are presented and discussed,
963,964.0,efficiency criteria for the operation of large libraries meier  it is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for the testing of theoretical hypotheses librarians and their assistants respect research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in helping the investigator even when they are skeptical rightfully in most instances of the usefulness of such research for the improvement of their own organizations data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices therefore significant results can often be obtained with smaller samples and in shorter periods of observation people working in libraries do not feel they should curtail disclosures about basic processes elsewhere professional employees are obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative committees at least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or more libraries almost always lie close at hand there could hardly be any more convenient institution,
964,965.0,the information needs of current scientific research menzel  the information demands or information needs of current scientific research are similar in many respects to the information needs in other forms of scholarship but this is not true in all cases and the focus of this paper is on the needs of the research scientists in discussing the information needs of the scientist i shall not limit myself to those for which library work is immediately relevant in fact a good part of this paper will call attention to the importance of those aspects of scientific communication that take place outside libraries and indeed outside literature there are of course very few aspects of scientific communication to which library work is not at least indirectly relevant,
965,966.0,the evidence underlying the cranfield results swanson  an indexing or classification system should be judged by the retrieval results it produces namely the extent to which it brings forth relevant material and rejects the irrelevant thus well designed experiments should permit judging the relative merits of different classification schemes this notion although self evident had remarkably little impact on the field of library science prior to the 1950 s during that decade the first controlled experiments on information retrieval were performed and these mark a turning point in the history of classification research for the first time experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical importance to indexing and classification it is my purpose here to review some aspects of the most notable of these experimental tests the aslib cranfield research project,
966,967.0,on improving communication among scientists swanson  libraries and information services of the twenty first century almost certainly will be the beneficiary or perhaps the victim of enormous technological change high speed search by computers microrecording techniques remote interrogation consoles and great communication networks will someday place the world s knowledge at our fingertips it is inferred by many that through such a metamorphosis we shall cure the information ills of our age bring order out of chaos and somehow contain the information explosion or at least reduce it to a small conflagration,

971,972.0,graph model for library information networks nance  the design and study of library information networks are enhanced by the use of the concepts which have been developed by graph theorists in this paper we expand upon this theme proposing a general network structure which we believe to be a good model for a wide variety of library and other information networks the basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of a hypothetical public library access network plan,
972,973.0,the divided catalog a summary of the literature grosser  in the earliest item 1905 in the bibliography here presented fletcher challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly predominant type of catalog in libraries he questions its advocates claim that it best meets a library s needs he advocates a divided catalog such as the one at amherst because for one thing the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields we find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography harris 1957 fletcher s article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog during that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but as thom q v indicates the greatest period of such activity started in 1937 our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began,
973,974.0,cost survey cost of ordering cataloging and preparations in southern california libraries macquarrie  it was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with the cost of ordering as part of the total acquisition process we also attempted to get indirect costs such as rent and utilities very few of the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct cost only we found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics were extremely difficult to determine since all the professional staff in the libraries concerned participated in book selection with the chief librarian performing most of it as a result the cost of book selection was exceedingly high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion,
974,975.0,why allocate bach  most academic librarians will no doubt agree with lyle s statement that the book fund is one of the most important items in the library budget fewer academic librarians however are likely to agree with the view that in their handling of the book budget college and university librarians for the most part have not been living up to their professional responsibilities,
975,976.0,cost accounting for the library brutcher  gessford  rixford  increasingly librarians have felt the need for more accurate cost data the prime reason for this need has been in the development and presentation of the budget which is the instrument used to determine and obtain the funds for the library s forthcoming fiscal period since libraries do not charge for the service they render their users they must derive the funds necessary for their operations and growth from supporting bodies such as federal state or local governments private institutions and industrial firms,
976,977.0,a study of the usage and retention of technical periodicals strain  limited physical space expansion an administrative consideration in every library becomes a stringent factor in the planning of special libraries while public and college libraries may have several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a building or area it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library weeding or storage requirements therefore are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries the limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals these collections grow rapidly this summarization of a recent study made by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals has potential for other libraries,
977,978.0,remarks on lc plans for implementation of new centralized acquisitions and cataloging program under title iic higher education act cronin  the general purpose of my part in this program discussion is to report to you on the new program of centralized acquisitions and cataloging to be undertaken by the library of congress under authorization granted under title iic of the higher education act of 1965 by this action the congress took two most important steps to aid libraries of higher education in the united states 1 it fully recognized for the first time the importance of granting federal aid and assistance toward solving the problem of cataloging in this country and 2 it gave the library of congress a clear mandate to provide new and unparalleled services for the benefit of academic and research libraries of this country,
978,979.0,automated acquisitions procedures at the university of michigan library dunlap  in june 1965 the acquisitions department of the university of michigan library began using a computer based system for ordering books and other library materials this is the beginning of an over all automated system for the acquisitions department and was designed with the assistance of robert o kindt systems analyst from the university s office of management services preliminary work on the automated system was begun in late 1963 and in september 1964 mr kindt was assigned to the university library on a full time basis after the preliminary proposal was drafted cost and feasibility studies were made current i e 1964 volume and costs were compared with anticipated volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems,
979,980.0,facsimile transmission in libraries a state of the art survey schatz  facsimile transmission is the rapid transmission of printed pages from one point to another using electronic devices all facsimile transmission methods require converting the original picture into an electrical impulse which is then transmitted over telephone lines private lines microwave or a combination of these communication links the receiving unit reconverts the electrical impulse into an exact duplicate of the original document on a screen or in the form of a hard copy,
980,981.0,statistics of collection overlap at the libraries of the six new england state universities nugent  as part of a design study to specify a regional processing center for the new england state university libraries it was required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries participating states were maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts rhode island and connecticut this overlap data was needed to predict the degree of joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of collective reclassification the results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections showing for example that a random title from one library had a 40 chance of being present in another randomly selected library when current imprint samples were tested the figure rose to 47 rhode island s holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest duplication elsewhere,

1007,1008.0,the measurement and evaluation of reference service rothstein  the measurement and evaluation of reference service has been more often discussed than attempted in fact the literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair sized literature of review admittedly the task is formidable as compared with other library activities such as circulation acquisitions and cataloging reference service is ill defined with little agreement on its component parts is inter library lending an integral part of reference work because many reference librarians are responsible for it formal instruction in the use of books and libraries the supervision of reference reading rooms the preparation of indexes and having decided what the genus reference librarian does how can one readily determine the effectiveness of his work or its impact reference librarians may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a problem but it is undeniably a big one,

1015,1016.0,numerical methods of bibliographic analysis brookes  it is only in the last eight or ten years that the numerical aspects of bibliography have attracted attention although some of the numerical regularities that occur in bibliography have been known for thirty or forty years results are therefore still meager and applications are still few moreover most of the work so far reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of the natural sciences this is in part because the secondary sources in the natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible data in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least restricted by linguistic barriers and in part because the proposed world wide systems such as those advocated in the unisist report offer an immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient systems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis however the field of possible application is gradually widening serious efforts are now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social sciences for example,
1016,1017.0,evaluation of adult reference service weech  the evaluation of reference service has received considerable attention in the literature over a comparatively long period but as samuel rothstein pointed out in his 1964 library trends article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service much of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place in the ten years since rothstein wrote his article there does seem to be more effort at evaluation of reference service undoubtedly many of the trends in recent evaluation are due to the influence of rothstein s article,
1017,1018.0,the library s public a report of the public library inquiry berelson  the following report on use of the public library is the product of two separate studies made for the public library inquiry one was the national sample survey of library use made for the inquiry by the survey research center of the university of michigan personal interviews of a half hour or more in length were held with 1 151 people selected at random in different counties scattered over the united states the sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons living in private households by this tested method the survey gathered information concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the public library and what changes or extension of library service people in general would prefer the survey also gathered information on the use of books obtained from sources other than the public library as well as the extent of regular use of newspapers radio magazines and movies,
1018,1019.0,determining the optimal number of volumes for a library s core collection trueswell  the concept of the core collection in a large library is not new the thought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the more frequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used there have been however difficulties in determining what volumes are to be included within the core collection it is usually necessary to establish a committee or group of professional people who determine usually by enumeration those volumes that should be included in the core collection often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of the individuals and although valid in many cases as desirable reading the core collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements,
1019,1020.0,ifla communications fiab humphreys  the traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries apart from those in germany or affected by german practice was imposed by the weight given to the processing divisions the order department which in university libraries did not include experts in book selection was not considered to be of comparable importance with the major department the cataloguing room which also housed the classifiers other divisions would be concerned with particular types of material maps state papers or official documents manuscripts oriental books and would be largely autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing the reading room staff were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library s collections especially on manuscripts or early printed books they rarely dealt with the general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present day reference librarians in these circumstances members of staff tended to become expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part in the activities of another divisions between the various kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library s organization could become similarly rigid it must be appreciated that this is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach nonetheless this conservative view of the library s function tended to freeze the administration into this form an expert in a particular subject field often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his field but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection with his library duties unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer orientalist or linguist the appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete re modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond the bounds of the old departments,
1020,1021.0,the subject specialist in national and university libraries with special reference to book selection danton  of the world s numerous kinds of libraries the national and the university may properly be characterized as having responsibilities for both general and universal or nearly universal collecting in the realm of scholarship that is these two and only these two commonly collect over a very broad spectrum and in depth material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be granted as it is here assumed that almost no field of human endeavor can advance without resort to the recorded past it is this twin aspect of the activity of these scholarly libraries collecting simultaneously in breadth and in depth which produces most of their major problems the concern of this paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most important and difficult the selection of materials and the utilization of subject specialists,
1021,1022.0,information science in librarianship hayes  these information systems create a real challenge for librarianship since on the surface it would seem that librarians can have a central role in their development their operation and their management but to do so librarians must recognize the contribution they can make and be willing to accept the challenges,
1022,1023.0,weeding the collection a review of research on identifying obsolete stock seymour  reverberations of the publishing explosion of recent years are reaching us now production of monographs and journals research reports and government documents has been increasing exponentially to the point that british university librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space which their american counterparts have been struggling with for a number of years judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in american library journals the force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds available for book purchasing and by the increasing price of books however when space in the library does become filled obviously something must be done to create more space because the flow of material is certainly not going to cease,

1029,1030.0,little science big science price  pegram lecturers are supposed to talk about science and its place in society the ordinary way of doing this would be either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the various styles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between men and science previous lecturers in this series have given accounts of the content of space science and made excursions into the philosophy and the history of science although professionally my concern is with the history of science i have a certain prehistoric past as a physicist and this has led me to treat these lectures in what is perhaps an extraordinary way my goal is not discussion of the content of science or even a humanistic analysis of its relations rather i want to clarify these more usual approaches by treating separately all the scientific analyses that may be made of science why should we not turn the tools of science on science itself why not measure and generalize make hypotheses and derive conclusions,

1035,1036.0,the management of innovation burns  all the research reported in this book arose out of an attempt some years ago to study an industrial concern as a community of people at work that is in much the same terms one would use in a study of conduct and relationships in a village an urban neighborhood or a small primitive community this aim was never realized because it soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked with and often mirrored that of the small isolated town in which it was situated the wider study which then appeared necessary was not practicable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively assuming its present significance only in the context of later studies,
1036,1037.0,towards a behavioral theory of communication ackoff  this paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the decision problems of the recipient the orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual s purposeful state specifically these elements are his objectives his valuation of each objective his possible courses of action the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective and his probability of choice for each course of action the amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action the amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the amount of information in the purposeful state following the message and the amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message the amount of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action and the amount of motivation is defined in terms of the values of the objectives the amounts of instruction and motivation in a message are defined just as information is by comparing the amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message the value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of the amount of information the amount of instruction and the amount of motivation in the state this concept can be generalized to express the value of the state to some other individual,
1037,1038.0,management misinformation systems ackoff  five assumptions commonly made by designers of management information systems are identified it is argued that these are not justified in many if not most cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems these assumptions are 1 the critical deficiency under which most managers operate is the lack of relevant information 2 the manager needs the information he wants 3 if a manager has the information he needs his decision making will improve 4 better communication between managers improves organizational performance and 5 a manager does not have to understand how his information system works only how to use it to overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system a procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given of the type of control system which it produces,
1038,1039.0,computational analysis of scoring models for r and d project selection moore  baker  several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis of the r and d project selection decision problem this research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements for example many authors recommend a multiplicative index over an additive index in order to generate a wide range of project scores the additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index the most serious shortcoming in the models however is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model considerations such as 1 the underlying distributions of project data 2 time preferences 3 the number of ranking intervals or categories and 4 the width of the intervals all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings,
1039,1040.0,a scoring methodology for assessing the suitability of management science models souder  in this study five major criteria realism flexibility capability case of use and cost for evaluating the suitability of management science models for r d project selection are established through personal interviews with r d administrators and management scientists a suitability rating system based on these criteria is used by the author to rate twenty six management science models for their suitability of use in r d project selection decision making profitability index and scoring types of models were found to have generally higher ease of use and lower cost performances than the other types the linear and nonlinear models had generally higher flexibility while the linear nonlinear and zero one models had generally higher realism than the other model types,
1040,1041.0,the managerial grid blake  the managerial grid method of designating various styles of leadership avoids these semantic traps even more it shows how a leader can simultaneously maximize both the methods which are production oriented and those which are people oriented thus instead of putting a manager in a dilemma of choosing one or the other alternative it illustrates that there are ways he can gain the benefits of both it puts various methods of managing problems into a framework where the leader can identify study and change his own behavior thus he is in a position to understand it better to evaluate the results it produces and to encourage its use by others,
1041,1042.0,the marc ii format a communications format for bibliographic data avram  the marc machine readable cataloging pilot project was an experiment to test the feasibility of distributing library of congress cataloging in machine readable form to a variety of users this project grew out of the conviction of many librarians that automation was becoming necessary if libraries were to keep up with the rising tide of new materials and the mounting demand for rapid information although there were other library procedures which stood to profit from mechanization it was felt that devising a method of recording bibliographical information in machine readable form was basic to the solution of other problems,
1042,1043.0,the marc pilot project the final report avram  the marc project has progressed from a pilot to test the feasibility of a distribution service of centrally produced machine readable cataloging data to a full scale operational system in the design stages in two short years the library community both here and abroad has accepted marc and recognizes its potential for the future the single most significant result of marc has been the impetus to set standards there is no doubt that eventually standards would have been designed for machine readable bibliographic records character sets and codes for place and language marc accelerated standardization and still more important the standards are being set and agreed to be a large segment of the library community the cooperation among the producers and users of bibliographic description has been a rewarding experience,
1043,1044.0,mathematical taxonomy jardine  in this book we give a mathematical account of some of the methods of data simplification which are involved in or suggested by the practice of biological taxonomy the computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful tools for taxonomists rather than as substitutes for their activities superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of classificatory systems biological taxonomy ecology psychology linguistics archaeology sociology etc but more detailed examination shows that the kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based differ widely from science to science whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here particularly in part ii of the book are more widely applicable we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy the emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under which their application is valid so that anyone who wishes to apply the methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations and of the lines along which they may profitably be developed and modified,
1044,1045.0,the mathematical theory of communication shannon  the word communication will be used here in a very broad sense to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another this of course involves not only written and oral speech but also music the pictorial arts the theatre the ballet and in fact all human behavior in some connections it may be desirable to use a still broader definition of communication namely one which would include the procedures by means of which one mechanism say automatic equipment to track an airplane and to compute its probably future positions affects another mechanism say a guided missile chasing this airplane the language of this memorandum will often appear to refer to the special but still very broad and important field of the communication of speech but practically everything said applies equally as well to music of any sort and to still or moving pictures as in television,
1045,1046.0,meaning and the structure of language chafe  the work to which this chapter forms a preface arises out of a deep and prolonged dissatisfaction which the author has felt with both past and present theories of the structure of language this dissatisfaction may be understood more readily and the suggestions which make up the body of this work may appear in clearer perspective if i begin with a few remarks of an autobiographical nature the intrinsic importance of these remarks is minimal but they may provide a useful background for what follows,
1046,1047.0,measurement of meaning osgood  the scientific study of language has been developing with particular rapidity during the past decade or so one thinks immediately of the basic work of zipf and skinner of the developments in information theory in concept formation in second language learning in work association research and generally of the increasing integration of the psychological and linguistic approaches as reflected in the activities of the social science research council committee on linguistics and psychology almost every new issue of a social science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity a significant aspect of much of this development has been the devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques during the past six or seven years a group of us at the university of illinois has been concentrating on the development of an objective measure of meaning and this book is largely a progress report of that research,
1047,1048.0,measurement of satisfaction in work and retirement smith  the focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle a strategy for the study of attitudes this strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction and particularly to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction in fact it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement rather than on just one or two elements of it which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners for the former it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction for too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices this has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument as a consequence this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction at the very least the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies if so this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction,
1048,1049.0,measuring the quality of library service a handbook beeler  there is probably no measurement task which public servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring the quality of service it is as difficult to measure the quality of hospital service or of schools or of social welfare programs as it is to determine the quality of library service it is equally as difficult to decide what actions to take in order to improve service legislators urban and regional planners consultants boards of trustees accrediting teams librarians and a host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some conclusions about the quality of service offered by library systems this handbook is intended for these groups and especially for practicing librarians the pervasiveness of the problem across all public service institutions however leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to other groups,
1049,1050.0,medical innovation a diffusion study coleman  the research reported here constitutes a case study in the acceptance of an innovation the innovation is a medical one a drug which physicians use in everyday practice the setting is in the midwestern united states in the 1950 s this study gives a glimpse of one small part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its allied institutions but more generally the question of the spread of an innovation is of interest to all students of society particularly in an age of change and in our complex and massive society an understanding of the way in which an innovation can spread for better or worse constitutes important knowledge of man it is to aid in this understanding as well as to describe the case at hand that this report is written,
1050,1051.0,medlars 1963 1967 austin  the purpose of this document is to present a final description of the system as it has evolved through a period of four years of operation this will add the final chapter to the present medlars story at a time when the library is on the threshold of developing an entirely new system utilizing the latest techniques of documentation and information science coupled with modern third generation computer equipment the reader interested in a complete chronicle of the library s experience with medlars is advised to combine the reading of this report with a re reading of the original medlars story thus he will be able to develop a complete picture that answers the questions 1 what did the library set out to do 2 what was actually accomplished and 3 what changes were made in the original system design and why,
1051,1052.0,melcher on acquisition melcher  this book originally set out to be a kind of reporting in depth of the american library association pre conference on acquisitions held in atlantic city in the summer of 1969 a report embracing not only the essential content of the formal speeches but also the floor discussions and after hours bull sessions meanwhile however a closely similar treatment of the problem of how to buy library materials long in process suddenly shaped up and was published by ala in november 1969 this was purchasing library materials in public and school libraries by evelyn hensel and peter d veilette a treatment of the acquisition process in college and university libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the january 1970 issue of library trends the acquisition problems of research libraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annual international seminars on approval and gathering plans in large and medium size academic libraries sponsored by western michigan university in the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969,
1052,1053.0,methods of information handling bourne  this book is meant to be an aid and reference work for those people who are interested in the design of information systems such information systems are typified by the traditional libraries but the same problems of information processing storage and retrieval are present in many government and industrial organizations in many places besides the library this book provides an illustration of the tools equipment and methodology that might be applied to those problems,
1053,1054.0,relevance predictability in information retrieval systems kent  belzer  kurfeerst  dym  shirey  bose  an experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems in effect since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one level of processing of the document e g the citation and or abstract it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes relevance however prior to such an analysis an even more elementary step had to be made namely to determine what portions of a document should be examined an evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products irps functioning as cues to the information content of full documents to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems was made under controlled experimental conditions the hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products selected extracts from the document i e first paragraph last paragraph and the combination of first and last paragraph that would be representative of the full document as the traditional irps citation and abstract was tested systematically the results showed that 1 there is no significant difference among the several irp treatment groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document 2 first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted relevancy to a higher degree that the other irps 3 abstracts were undistinguished as predictors and 4 the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not substantive some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous work with unmotivated subjects,
1054,1055.0,the use of biomedical periodical literature at the national lending library for science and technology wood  bower  the paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use of biomedical periodical literature carried out at the uk national lending library in february 1969 the survey was designated to discover the subject date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature the most frequently requested journals and the most popular sources of references to biomedical publications the loans were spread over 1 084 titles although 9 per cent of the issues involved only 2 per cent of the titles the literature in most demand was less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests were for literature lss than 3 1 2 years old the half life for the biological literature was somewhat longer at 5 3 4 years the majority of issues 87 8 per cent involved english language periodicals overall the principal sources of references to the requested literature were citation lists in other periodical articles regarding the more recent literature however abstracting and indexing journals were the primary sources of information for medical references index medicus was the most used indexing publication and for biological references current contents,
1055,1056.0,metropolitan public library bundy  public libraries in the 1960 s which are active and alert and interested in meeting the interests of their various publics face problems far different from those of even a decade ago the maryland metropolitan area is an example of the many changes taking place in metropolitan areas which require corresponding change in the type and form and arrangements for library service and even demand looking into the very nature of library service itself,
1056,1057.0,the microtext reading room part ii fair  part i dealt with the selection of a microtext manager and with procedural consideration in the acquisition process part ii continues the discussion about acquisitions including considerations of format variation and reliability of publisher supplied project information the library s search for an adequate system of bibliographic control is examined cataloging methods classification schemes and hardcopy guides and indexes are discussed as components of bibliographic control,
1057,1058.0,user resistance to microforms in the research library salmon  microforms enjoy only limited acceptance in research libraries largely because of user resistance a growing number of published studies indicate that improper production inadequate bibliographic access lack of standardization defects in equipment design maintenance problems poor environments for microform usage and certain inherent characteristics of the microforms themselves all combine to make their use inconvenient solutions to most of these problems have existed for some time but the microform industry has been slow to correct them some positive developments have occurred in the last two years but the major problems remain,
1058,1059.0,microform information sources publications and hardware diaz  this article lists and describes articles books and services that provide information about publications available in microform and about microform hardware,
1059,1060.0,microforms in libraries diaz  why do libraries use microforms according to a 1974 survey by a micropublisher saving space was the reason given by most respondents holmes on the other hand found to acquire materials not otherwise available as the major reason others include 1 instead of binding serials journals are retained unbound for two to three years after publication the period of heaviest use and are then discarded and replaced by microform versions 2 to preserve deteriorating materials 3 easing access to bulky materials such as newspapers 4 to provide working copies of materials too delicate for continued use such as rare books 5 to save money in most cases the cost of an out of print set or serial backfile will be substantially less in microform than the cost of a full size reprint or the cost of the original on the used book market 6 ease of acquisition i e acquiring materials which would otherwise be difficult to acquire 7 mutilations reduced,
1060,1061.0,milestones in cataloging lehnus  in the case of the present study dr lehnus was interested in applying a method in a non standard way for that method to a type of literature that had not been addressed so far he proposed to begin with a single monograph on the subject cataloging apply the method of citation analysis to the references of that work and determine whether a core literature on cataloging could be discovered in this way there are innumerable examples of core literatures in scientific fields obtained from journal articles or through the science citation index but research via the monograph in non scientific subjects has been minimal,
1061,1062.0,patterns of evaluation in science institutionalization structure and functions of the referee system zuckerman  merton  the referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication the referee is thus an example of status judges who are charged with evaluating the quality of role performance in a social system they are found in every institutional sphere other kinds of status judges include teachers assessing the quality of work by students and as a recent institutional change students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers critics in the arts supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in sports status judges are integral to any system of social control through their evaluation of role performance and their allocation of rewards for that performance they influence the motivation to maintain or to raise standards of performance,
1062,1063.0,the development of a scientific specialty the phage group and the origins of molecular biology mullins  this paper analyses the formation of a new discipline molecular biology from the development of phage work it argues that such social variables as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain phage work s development into the specialty of molecular biology even though persons in physics a field with high academic standing decided to enter biology which had a lower academic standing and even though some recruiting of students occurred these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions in the emergence of molecular biology from phage work the variables of status and competitive position adduced by professors ben david and collins to explain the emergence of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and philosophy seem to be less important than other normal activities which occur in scientific development,
1063,1064.0,modern manuscripts a practical manual for their management care and use duckett  the title of this book is intended to indicate that its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth century to the present examples and techniques are drawn from institutions in the united states with occasional references to practices in great britain and canada the book is directed toward the novice curator of manuscripts and again as the title indicates it is intended to serve as a practical guide not as an exposition of theory,
1064,1065.0,modern organizations etzione  the plan of this book follows our definition of organizations as social units that pursue specific goals which they are structured to serve obviously under some social circumstances therefore the book has three foci organizational goals organizational structure and organizations and their social environment considerably more space is devoted to organizational structure than to the other topics for two reasons first more research has been conducted and more writings are available on organizational structure than on organizational goals chapter 2 and environment second the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed their interests on structural aspects of the organization and thus we may best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational structure,
1065,1066.0,a modern outline of library classification mills  this outline is based mainly on lectures given at the north western polytechnic to students studying for the library association s registration examination in classification and cataloguing it is hoped that it will help to meet the need increasingly felt in recent years by students and teachers of the subject for a reasonably simple textbook on library classification which takes account of the considerable developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years as is well known a great deal of this has been due to dr ranganathan and also in more recent years to mr b c vickery as a result of these developments a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments in subject analysis in notation and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders it is now possible to construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions of relating subjects helpfully and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used moreover they are easier to construct,
1066,1067.0,modern systems research for the behavioral scientist a sourcebook buckley  although it is hoped that this sourcebook will be of interest to those of any discipline concerned with new developments in science of the last quarter century it is addressed principally to the student of human behavior as that study is approached from the social side this is so partly because that is the editor s main competence and interest but primarily because the study of human behavior is the general area of science that has least responded to the exciting challenge of the modern systems outlook yet it is precisely this general area that stands to gain the most from insights into the workings of the more complex types of systems,
1067,1068.0,monteith college library experiment knapp  our report on the analysis of social structure in the monteith library project begins with discussion of certain general characteristics of research of this type and with comments on the academic institution as a specific type of formal organization we turn next to a consideration of particular social science concepts found useful in bringing into focus significant features of the monteith structure finally we discuss the effect of these monteith structural features upon the library project at each stage of its development,
1068,1069.0,motivation and personality maslow  this book was started during the years 1935 1936 and was intended to be a systematic psychology of the older type my effort was to synthesize the holistic the dynamic and the cultural emphases which each one excited so many young psychologists of the time i felt that they were intrinsically related to each other and that they were subaspects of a single larger encompassing whole i felt also that they would make more meaningful my previous studies at the university of wisconsin in comparative and experimental psychology and in biology and neurophysiology furthermore i felt that they would enable me to serve better my humanistic aims,
1069,1070.0,the motivation to work herzberg  this book reports the findings from a study of job motivation based on a fresh approach to this problem it is an important study since the analyses and interpretations of the authors suggest that a breakthrough may well have been made to provide new insights into the nature and method of operation of job attitudes the senior authors were well prepared for their task having recently completed a comprehensive review and analysis of the research in this field reported in job attitudes review of research and opinion this review of several thousand articles and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much disagreement and confusion in the field it appeared that one of the major contributors to this apparent diversity of results was the unstable nature of the subjective data on which studies in this field have been typically based,
1070,1071.0,an integrated health science core library for physicians nurses and allied health practitioners in community hospitals ratcliff  this core medical library has been revised updated and expanded in the hope of providing a single library facility for the entire health care team items were included in the list on the basis of recommendations submitted by specialists in the pertinent fields the expanded core collection costs about 4 000 space requirements are about 40 linear feet for books 90 feet for journals and 15 feet for reference tools,
1071,1072.0,gremas a system for classification and documentation in organic chemistry fugmann  brann  vanpel  the authors of this essay were faced with the task of organizing a documentation office in which a large number of publications and patents in chemistry would have to be processed this large collection would be made available to a large group of elements without restrictions to permit a large frequency of use and to maintain this also with increases in file sizes it becomes necessary to limit especially that faction of the task which consists in the retrieval activities paper savings in the retrieval activity are possible only at the expense of greater effort in indexing and by heavier use of technical aids we have taken the second path by consciously applying the principles to a highly detailed faceted classification,

1078,1079.0,national aspects of creating and using marc recon records rather  concurrently with the recon pilot project the recon working task force undertook to consider certain basic questions of retrospect conversation that are of national scope first is it feasible to define a level or subset of the marc format that would allow a library using the lower level to be part of a future national network second is it possible to use machine readable records from a variety of sources in a national bibliographic store as a way to reduce the conversion effort on the national level third what are the problems of producing a national union catalog from machine readable records as these studies and the pilot project progressed it also became apparent that there were many practical difficulties in carrying out a large scale conversion project therefore it seemed essential to investigate alternative strategies for recon that might yield broad benefits in a reasonable short time span,
1079,1080.0,national document handling systems for science and technology carter  this book has grown out of a study undertaken for the committee on scientific and technical information cosati task group on national systems s for scientific and technical information in support of their examination of national document and information systems the emphasis of the study as stated by cosati is as follows 1 initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems relating to scientific and technical documents their handling and the management of such documents specific matters to be reported on will include the current organizational and functional situation in the united states the extent to which known deficiencies are causing a reduction in the potential for technical effectiveness in the united states scientific and technical community the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for correction of these deficiencies and one or more action plans which can be followed by governmental especially including congress and non governmental units 2 secondary attention will be given to development of programs which can be undertaken with government support for identifying analyzing and giving a structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in the united states,
1080,1081.0,generalization of epidemic theory an application to the transmission of ideas goffman  newill  one of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrieval is that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary to introduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population of scientists it is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the transmission and development of ideas within a population specifically the transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the transmission of an infectious disease that is in terms of an epidemic process an attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the development of such a process,
1081,1082.0,mathematical approach to the spread of scientific ideas the history of mast cell research goffman  one of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature of its own growth indeed there are few notable scientists who have not at one time or another given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development these questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right goffman and newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process consequently a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development in particular this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area the purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells in his recent comprehensive survey of this subject prof hens selye has assembled a full bibliography in which every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with this bibliography constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of scientific ideas since it provides us with all the contributions to the subject area from ehrlich s discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963,

1089,1090.0,library optimum sandison  sir in his recent article b c brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold he is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the bradford set change from year to year there is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant but the position of the bradfod set is less satisfactory the nature conservancy librarians j m weingott and s m penny unpublished have lent me a list of titles cited in the journal of ecology three or more times in 1955 56 and a similar list for 1965 66 there are 150 periodical titles in the two lists but only forty two 28 appear in both of the thirty three titles cited nine or more times in either year only eight 25 attained that level in both and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year the kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0 18 and not significant there is another major practical problem the article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers there is no mention of the type of data to use the reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use krauze and hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than brookes suggests in any case the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close for example one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers again each citation represents an author s selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library in neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers,
1090,1091.0,effectiveness of combining title words and index terms in machine retrieval searches fisher  our experiment was based on volume 24 of nuclear science abstracts nsa which contains about 53 000 citations we used the generalized file management system master control which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode the inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs for example an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs for example an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base plus the record numbers in which each word was found in master control a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank period comma colon etc on the other hand in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word character by character which results in a prohibitively time consuming process for large data bases we chose the inverted table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles nsa index terms and titles and index terms combined nsa index terms are controlled by the euratom thesaurus as revised for nsa we used two criteria in the study first the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff to be run concurrently on the same data base on an sdi basis the others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment second citations obtained were to be considered good or relevant only if they actually pertained to the subject in question otherwise they were to be considered false drops regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation,

1209,1210.0,is there a pecking order in physics journals analysis of close to a million citations puts physical review at the top of the list but the order changes when we adjust for impact and immediacy inhaber  when physicists wish to communicate their work by means of publication several considerations are weighed before choosing the appropriate journal there is the matter of audience of the probable delay between acceptance and publication of article format letter review standard research report if the article is potentially controversial the author may estimate its chances of being accepted by different journals considerations of national pride may sway the choice an author may submit a work to a journal in his own country rather than to one that has a greater circulation and impact but is published in a foreign country,

1212,1213.0,plans and structure of behavior miller  the notion of a plan that guides behavior is again not entirely accidentally quite similar to the notion of a program that guides an electronic computer in order to discover how to get the image into motion therefore we reviewed once more the cybernetic literature on the analogies between brains and computers between minds and programs our fundamental concern however was to discover whether the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology the men who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent about psychology the creatures whose behavior they want to simulate often seem more like a mathematician s dream than like living animals but in spite of all the evidence we refused to believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or even an advantage there must be some way to phrase the new ideas so that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior that psychologists have created it was the search for that favorable intersection that directed the course of our year long debate,
1213,1214.0,the practice of management drucker  we have available today the knowledge and experience needed for the successful practice of management but there is probably no field of human endeavor where the always tremendous gap between the knowledge and performance of the leaders and the knowledge and performance of the average is wider or more intractable this book does not exclude from its aims the advancement of the frontier of knowledge it hopes indeed to make some contribution to it but its first aim is to narrow the gap between what can be done and what is being done between the leaders in management and the average,
1214,1215.0,precis a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing austin  in 1951 the british bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to british libraries twenty years later with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques bnb again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted precis from its first issues of 1971 to explain why this change was felt to be necessary we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so two forces in particular have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period firstly the introduction of computers secondly and concomitantly the development of bibliographic data exchange networks of which marc is perhaps the primary example in some respects precis represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing traditionally indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which once identified by the indexer would be offered as the user s access point to the alphabetical file this applied most obviously to subject heading systems a good deal of cutter s rules for a dictionary catalog is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user s access point even when this entailed a distortion of natural language and the production of inverted headings the unselected component would then be lost as an entry word unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings in which case none of these headings would be co extensive with the subject of the document,
1215,1216.0,prejudices and antipathies a tract on the lc subject heads concerning people berman  since the first edition of library of congress subject headings appeared 60 years ago american and other libraries have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority if not the sole basis for subject cataloging there can be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a labor saving worry reducing work nor abstractly about its value as a global standardizing agent a means for achieving some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic undoubtedly it is a real boon to scholars as well as to ordinary readers to find familiar fairly constant headings in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as washington dc and lusaka zambia knowledge and scholarship are after all universal and a subject scheme should ideally manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the worldwide reading community should that is but in the realm of headings that deal with people and cultures in short with humanity the lc list can only satisfy parochial jingoistic europeans and north americans white hued at least nominally christian and preferably protestant in faith comfortably situated in the middle and higher income brackets largely domiciled in suburbia fundamentally loyal to the established order and heavily imbued with the transcendent incomparable glory of western civilization further it reflects a host of untenable indeed obsolete and arrogant assumptions with respect to young people and women and exudes something less than sympathy or even fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or avant garde,

1220,1221.0,problems in organizing library collections hickey  in the area of library work often called cataloging and more broadly technical services the student may fall into two errors that of assuming that all work is strictly routine and mechanical and that of viewing the tasks of organizing a library collection as self contained one purpose of the case studies here presented is to help correct both these errors and to do so by illuminating some of the ways in which interpersonal relations affect the character of the routines and by setting the organizational tasks in the broader context of the total library situation,

1223,1224.0,on one model of semantic information theory shreider  text processing problems such as automatic translation and automatic abstracting create a need for defining explicit concepts which should be characterized as the properties and quantity of semantic information contained in document texts in fact we need a formal model which lets us describe the process of semantic text analysis semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someone with a different conception of the world e g the text of very meaningful article does not contain in fact any information for people who are not specialists in the given mathematic field therefore the formal model must contain descriptions of the conception of the world of the given observer such a description we call a thesaurus semantic text analysis we interpret as changing the thesaurus in response to a given text,

1226,1227.0,production and distribution machlup  anything that goes under the name of production and distribution sounds as if it clearly fell into the economist s domain an analysis of knowledge on the other hand seems to be the philosopher s task though some aspects of it are claimed by the sociologist but if one speaks of the communication of knowledge in the united states the specialist in education may feel that this is in his bailiwick also the mathematician or operations researcher specializing in communication theory and information systems may prick up his ears in fact some of the knowledge to be discussed here is technological and thus the engineer may properly be interested when i tried out the title of this study on representatives of various disciplines many were rather surprised that an economist would find himself qualified to undertake this kind of research,

1231,1232.0,the magical number seven plus or minus two some limits on our capacity for processing information miller  my problem is that i have been persecuted by an integer for seven years this number has followed me around has intruded in my most private data and has assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals this number assumes a variety of disguises being sometimes a little larger and sometimes a little smaller than usual but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable the persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than a random accident there is to quote a famous senator a design behind it some pattern governing its appearances either there really is something unusual about the number or else i am suffering from delusions of persecution,
1232,1233.0,a theory of human motivation maslow  the present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive theory of motivation which will satisfy these theoretical demands and at the same time conform to the known facts clinical and observational as well as experimental it derives most directly however from clinical experience this theory is i think in the functionalist tradition of james and dewey and is fused with the holism of wertheimer goldstein and gestalt psychology and with the dynamicism of freud and adler this fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily be called a general dynamic theory,
1233,1234.0,multidimensional scaling by optimizing goodness of fit to a nonmetric hypothesis kruskal  multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects geometrically by n points so that the interpoint distances correspond in some sense to experimental dissimilarities between objects in just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related we define a quantitative intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit a practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper,
1234,1235.0,public knowledge an essay concerning the social dimension of science ziman  natural science whose internal development for three centuries is so uniform well documented and relatively self generating is an obvious candidate for such treatment and having noticed the intellectual connections between the ideas of various scholars we must surely pass on to an investigation of the social relations through which those connections are established how do scientists teach communicate with promote criticize honour give ear to give patronage to one another what is the nature of the community to which they adhere,

1241,1242.0,quantitative methods hoadley  this institute was designed both to encourage the use of quantitative measurement and to teach the techniques necessary for such use it was hoped that an emphasis on statistical measurement would upgrade administrative and research skills and thus contribute to more efficient and effective library management studies of librarians academic backgrounds have indicated a preponderance of humanities and social science majors in the field too often librarians have had only a few courses in mathematics and some actually have a psychological antipathy toward numbers this anti mathematics syndrome has kept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitative methods,
1242,1243.0,rare book librarianship cave  although there is an extensive and enjoyable literature on the subject of rare books most of it is concerned with bibliography or book collecting and relatively little on the librarianship of rare books is available this book is an attempt to consider some of the problems of custodianship and exploitation of special collections in libraries problems sufficiently different i believe to make the concept of rare book librarianship a valid one it is based distantly upon lecture notes for a course on this subject which was offered to postgraduate students at loughborough university,

1244,1245.0,reader in documents of international organizations stevens  the purpose of this volume is to give an insight into the nature and scope of the documents of international organizations and to provide information about the work of documentalists and librarians in making the mass of information available in these documents available to readers all too many librarians regard government documents and in particular the documents of international agencies as esoteric unlike the usual library materials in format and publication pattern and as presenting problems of acquisitions control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to the specialist in documents the result is that international documents are a puzzlement to the general librarian and a source of frustration to the ill informed administrator a situation exacerbated by the present general tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of a general course in government documents to which relatively few students are exposed the information in this volume will allay the fears of the generalist librarian it also provides the data on which to base additional emphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum,

1247,1248.0,reader in library service and the computer kaplan  the selections are intended mainly for students in library schools and for librarians in the field who have not yet made themselves conversant with the literature of computer based operations this is not a book to state the proposition in the negative for those who wish to read on the theoretical aspects of computers the selections are brought together in seven sections the first the challenge includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age of the computer the second section varieties of response does not by any means exhaust developments in american libraries it does i believe contain representative descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished the third section theory of management contains an outstanding article by richard degennaro of harvard the particular contributions made in this article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section news services the fourth section required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer the considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section while those that follow describe specific services now being offered or services in the planning stage the material in the fifth section catalogs and the computer is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion the two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject namely filing problems and comparative costs the sixth section copyright contains an article from the legal point of view the more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by verner clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings the seventh section information retrieval testing is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable,
1248,1249.0,reader in medical librarianship sewell  each kind of librarianship partakes of the general elements of librarianship and each has a flavor all its own this book is intended to present the flavor and philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice if it gives a new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health science organizations so much the better if it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation it is so no longer one must conceive of them as part of a medical system and indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine as practiced by a single physician for a single patient it extends into the health sciences as represented by dentists pharmacists nurses veterinarians medical technologists medical associates and dozens of others some not yet possessing a clear identity it includes research education and practice in addition to the clinical sciences the system involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health increasingly socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream of medicine,
1249,1250.0,reader in research methods for librarianship bundy  the fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to the goals of librarianship viewed in this way and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research the editors concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution with the modes of analysis the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment seen thus as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity who have not before held this perspective of research,
1250,1251.0,reader in technical services applebaum  this collection attempts to bring together a readable and germane group of materials ranging from history review papers and practical exposition to reports on current research and development and conjecture about the future it is expected that these selections will be of interest and use to the teacher and student it is also hoped that they will be of equal interest to the professional librarian and researcher there has been a deliberate attempt to exclude materials that have appeared in recently published collections it is for this reason that the names of panizzi cutter martel hanson dewey rider bliss haykin shera lubetzky and others do not appear a specific focus has been given to this book it is in the direction of a rational sharing of local national and international efforts and the eventual coordination and standardization of practices in the technical services insofar as this is practical,
1251,1252.0,the recording of library of congress bibliographical data in machine form buckland  this report describes the results of a study of a practical method of preparing library of congress card catalog data in machine form for 1 the automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs and 2 distribution to other libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic and typographic applications of such data including preparation of local catalogs the first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the card after the data is edited and corrected it is processed by a computer to form 1 catalog card typesetting tapes 2 the national union catalog 3 library of congress books subjects catalog magnetic tape catalog files and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution the procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on library of congress cards should studies find that the value of the data exceeds the cost of recording it a demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce perforated tape records these record tapes were automatically converted to a variety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book catalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards,
1252,1253.0,relegation and stock control in libraries urquhart  stock control has been defined by buckland as the managerial problem of organising the physical availability of books in relation to readers while it has long been recognised that only a proportion of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with remarkable speed in certain cases some new buildings are full even before they have left the design board stage it is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by r b morris in 1963 that in terms of long range perspective responsible judgement suggests that there is no feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous programme of selective book retirement library stock control has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems of acquisition and the provision of an ever increasing range of services for readers early investigations of this issue have tended to be theoretical and carol seymour in her review weeding the collection put forward the view that a librarian should be able to begin his plan for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary he also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden the pebul report summarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it observed that weeding the bookstock in academic libraries was the ungrasped nettle,

1255,1256.0,the growth of the literature of physics anthony  east  slater  an examination is made of the current problems of the communication and dissemination of literature in the field of physics the growth of the literature is considered quantitatively with respect to the form subject and origin of published material this is related to the general growth in scientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of expenditure on research the results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of information transfer and the reactions of users to new services intended to remedy the deficiencies finally a number of recently established services some designed to meet hitherto unsatisfied needs are described the role of the computer in the development of local national and international documentation systems is examined,
1256,1257.0,research libraries and technology fussler  the focus of the report is primarily upon the problems of the large university research oriented library it is here that one finds the most difficult resource access and bibliographical control problems if one can significantly improve both of these operations for the large research oriented institutions there are likely to be direct or indirect benefits for the smaller library while the reverse situation is much less likely,
1257,1258.0,resources and bibliographic support for a nationwide library program final report to the national commission for libraries and information science palmour  foremost among the nationwide goals of the library community is the access to needed information resources for all persons in all locations in the u s the perceived right of individuals to such access provides the foundation for national information planning for each library even the largest the hope of adequately supplying its identified user groups has been greatly constrained by simultaneous inflation of both cost and quantity of materials while future technological developments may well make possible on line full text retrieval of all library materials at local terminals or the instantaneous remote publication of materials upon demand the present situation requires more immediate solutions,
1258,1259.0,categories and relators a new scheme perreault  if the major premise is accepted that fully effective machine strategization of a retrieval system depends upon the use of a hierarchically structural but highly flexible notation as the equivalent for the verbal access provided by either unitermic or articulated conceptual indicators a faceted classification logically emerges as the desideratum the two aspects of a structural notation most determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform use of general categories the latter not merely for the sake of uniformity as such but as the means to a heightened flexibility these desiderata could of course be present on the idea plane alone but without their being present notationally they do not furnish to a mechanized retrieval system the type of assistance it requires for optimal functioning the second minor premise ought to be that the universal decimal classification being both hierarchical and general categoric provides the desired structurality but the melancholy fact is that this desideratum is not always satisfied for instance when udc uses direct division of a hierarchy when division by general category would be equally appropriate,

1261,1262.0,the rise of anthropological theory harris  my main reason for writing this book is to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man there is an urgency associated with this rededication which grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international development programs a general theory of history is required if the expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned journals the publishing of more and more about less and less is an acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues,

1269,1270.0,science since babylon price  this book had its origin in a set of five public lectures given at the sterling memorial library at yale university during october and november 1959 under the auspices of the yale department of history the subject whatever its name had just come through a stage in its growing up during which it almost seemed as though every would be practitioner of the art deemed it necessary to exhibit the completeness of his dedication by writing the history of the whole of science through all its periods hoping that this historiographic phase had evaporated and feeling incompetent in too many scientific and historical directions i resolved instead to essay the experiment of speaking only from those areas in which i had reasonable firsthand experience at research,
1270,1271.0,is a scientific revolution taking place in psychology palermo  my plan in this paper is to try to apply to the field of experimental psychology the analysis of the characteristics of science and more particularly the structure of scientific revolutions as conceptualized by t s kuhn kuhn has not been accepted without criticism but that need not prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion i assume that the reader will be familiar with kuhn s analysis so that only a sketchy summary of his position is necessary i will then take a brief look at some of the history of psychology with special emphasis upon the major tenets of behaviorism finally i will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well be living in an era of revolution within psychology as well as without,
1271,1272.0,is a kuhnian analysis applicable to psychology briskman  as my title might suggest i wish to discuss some aspects of palermo s recent paper the thesis which palermo advocated is that kuhn s view of scientific revolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology and that in particular experimental psychology has had two paradigms already with the appropriate scientific revolution between them and that the current behavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of kuhnian crisis the present note is divided into three parts the first questions palermo s assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a standard kuhnian paradigm change the second closely tied to the first challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a kuhnian paradigm finally the third supports palermo s thesis that behaviorism is in a crisis state but advances an alternative account of the reasons for this,
1272,1273.0,bibliographical statistics as a guide to growth points in science meadows  o connor  efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about trends in science for example there has been a continuing interest in the question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its age these investigations have however been mainly concerned with the major branches of science only and have also perhaps been rather more interested in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future although such results are obviously valuable it is also important to push these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject division since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical properties from the subject average one particularly important aspect of such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline we can specifically pose the question is it possible purely from a statistical analysis of scientific research papers to identify the appearance of a new growth area and if so how soon after its first appearance can such an area be identified,
1273,1274.0,the structure of scientific literatures ii toward a macro and microstructure for science griffith  small  stonehill  dey  part i of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific literature using a new technique co citation to measure the degree of similarity among documents the work developed directly from an earlier paper which defined this measure and explored its relationship to other citation measures for identifying relationships among documents we now report the outcome of an attempt to create maps of the scientific literature the scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present not only an overview of all highly cited papers in natural science but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty at each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science,
1274,1275.0,college libraries and chemical education gross  the small college has stood staunch in its desire to supply the liberal education and perhaps it has done well in maintaining this position on the other hand many of the large universities have shifted the emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study still others have tried to develop both side by side few of the small colleges have kept astride with the inevitable consequences of such a situation the few who have are sending an increasing number of their graduates to these universities to complete their training as an example of this it is the boast of pomona college that over seventy per cent of her graduates have taken subsequent professional training it has become the evident duty therefore of the small college to prepare its men not only to enter such graduate schools but also to meet successfully the ever increasing intensity of competition found there this in addition to supplying a broad cultural education this duty has brought with it a number of problems of first magnitude one of the biggest of these is the problem of adequate library facilities it is the purpose of this paper to discuss this problem with special reference to the student whose college major is chemistry,
1275,1276.0,serial literature used by american geologists gross  woodford  the present investigation deals with the serial literature of geology including mineralogy six american journals for 1929 were chosen and the references tabulated in table i are listed these source journals together with the total number of pages of the actual articles studied the total number of citations in each journal the number of references to books and to personal communications and the net total which represents the citations to serial literature it is these last mentioned references which will be considered in further detail the totals are probably slightly high due to unintentional counting in single articles of repetitions of the same citation,
1276,1277.0,citation indexes for science garfield  in this paper i propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent incomplete or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers it is too much to expect a research worker to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of antecedent papers it would not be excessive to demand that the thorough scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers if they could be located quickly the citation index makes this check practicable even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing the citation of poor data the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it this paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a new approach to subject control of the literature of science by virtue of its different construction it tends to bring together material that would never be collated by the usual subject indexing it is best described as an association of ideas index and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires suggestiveness through association of ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading,

1285,1286.0,quantitative growth of the mathematical literature may  since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year measured by counts of titles abstracted has grown from about 800 to 13 000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2 5 percent per year doubling about four times a century deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war depression and recovery if the total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from the curve of annual output the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles grows from 41 000 in 1867 to 419 000 by the end of 1965 deviations from an exponential growth of 2 5 percent per year are negligible except for two pauses during world wars after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve the well known hypothesis of exponential growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less than half that found by price and other investigators the discrepancy appears to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the titles published before the beginnings of the time series used,

1308,1309.0,science and information theory brillouin  a new scientific theory has been born during the last few years the theory of information it immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly this new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems how is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted how does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals how does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices all of these problems and many similar ones are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively from these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character this theory is based on probability considerations once stated in a precise way it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions it enables one to solve the problem of maxwell s demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy the thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory it is paid for by an increase of entropy and a generalized carnot principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained information corresponds to negative entropy a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy the generalized carnot principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information this principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics,

1327,1328.0,developments in data analysis armor  the last ten years have witnessed rapid and often radical changes in computer programming systems for social science data at least a dozen different program packages collections or systems not to mention hundreds of individual programs have emerged by now and are in use by social scientists at universities and research centers all across the country it is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systems and programs represent the individual efforts of a small group working at one institution often operating under a relatively restricted set of research and computing assumptions this parochial tendency has left students and researchers with the often bewildering and always time consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their data each time they change institutions or each time the institution changes computers,
1328,1329.0,the social construction of reality a treatise on the sociology of knowledge armor  the present volume is intended as a systematic theoretical treatise in the sociology of knowledge it is not intended therefore to give a historical survey of the development of this discipline or to engage in exegesis of various figures in this other other developments in sociological theory or even to show how a synthesis may be achieved between several of these figures and developments nor is there any polemic intent here critical comments on other theoretical positions have been introduced not in the text but in the notes only where they may serve to clarify the present argument,
1329,1330.0,the social function of science bernal  the events of the past few years have led to a critical examination of the function of science in society it used to be believed that the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous progressive improvements in conditions of life but first the war and then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as easily for destructive and wasteful purpose and voices have been raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only means of preserving a tolerable civilization scientists themselves faced with these criticisms have been forced to consider effectively for the first time how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them this book is an attempt to analyze this connection to investigate how far scientists individually and collectively are responsible for this state of affairs and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science,
1330,1331.0,social mobility in industrial society lipset  in the present study professors lipset and bendix cast doubt on the validity of a number of widely accepted generalizations relating to social mobility particularly 1 that there has been substantially less mobility in europe than in the united states 2 that social mobility tends to decline as industrial societies mature and 3 that opportunities for entrance into the business elite become more restricted with mature industrialization in a careful analysis of the existing literature the authors marshal an imposing array of evidence in support of their major thesis that social mobility is an integral and continuing aspect of the process of industrialization,
1331,1332.0,social organization of hamadryas baboons kummer  baboons have adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from west african rain forests to semidesert areas on the coast of the red sea while all baboons are morphologically adapted to life on the ground some species have become more independent of trees than others in a rough ecological series we find on one end the forest dwelling west african species mandrillus leucophaneus m sphinx papio papio none of which has so far been studied in the field the first step into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of south and east africa including from south to north the species papio ursinus cynocephalus and anubis their social organization and its ecological context have been subject to long range field work by hall 1962 a b in south africa by devore 1962 in kenya and by altmann and altmann in preparation in kenya ad tanzania in both regions the groups can range far into the open grassland but at night they withdraw to high trees or as in the cape region to vertical cliffs,
1332,1333.0,the social psychology of organizations katz  in our attempts to extend the description and explanation of organizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis on traditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonal relations to system constructs the interdependent behavior of many people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate collective level classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social structures the development of open system theory on the other hand furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework hence our effort in the pages that follow is directed at the utilization of an open system point of view for the study of large scale organizations,
1333,1334.0,cognitive technical and social factors in the growth of radio astronomy mulkay  edge  we have tried in this paper to describe some of the main features of the emergence and growth of radio astronomy with special reference to the crucial developments occurring in the uk much of what we have written above needs to be discussed in the light of current theories about the nature of scientific growth and compared with data from other case studies,
1334,1335.0,career contingencies and the fate of sociological research oromaner  during the past three hundred years the journal article has become the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal zuckerman and merton 1971 who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly and in particular scientific disciplines there have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications this career i suggest can be conceptualized into three stages 1 pre publication here the scholar writes the article circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings garvey lin and nelson 1971 2 publication here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration zuckerman and merton 1971 3 post publication here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work the practice of citing a colleague s work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline,
1335,1336.0,exit voice and loyalty further reflections and a survey of recent contributions hirschman  my book exit voice and loyalty responses to decline in firms organizations and states was published in l970 reactions to it and applications of its concepts have been fairly numerous and i have myself had quite a few afterthoughts it will therefore be difficult to bring these matters together in a passably structured paper in the following i shall limit myself to four broad areas of inquiry which have been so arranged that my own further reflections figure rather prominently though by no means exclusively in the first two sections while the latter two are more heavily weighted with reports and comments on the research and contributions of others,
1336,1337.0,social stratification in science cole  in recent years social scientists have given increased attention to problems of inequality justice and discrimination in american society the influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals is being studied in an effort to estimate the fairness of social institutions in rewarding talent social scientists are trying to determine the extent to which so called irrelevant characteristics influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income prestige and influence of the major institutions in american society science has received perhaps the least systematic attention little is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown this book examines several aspects of a single basic question is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment a more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for recognition in the social system of science,
1337,1338.0,notes and letters moravcsik  murugesan  we tried to concentrate on a few variables that might define the nature of a citation and to keep the rest of the variables constant in particular we used references in articles in a single journal in a single specialty of a single branch of science and in a narrow time period specifically we investigated 30 articles dealing with theoretical high energy physics and published in physical review in the years 1968 to 1972 inclusive,
1338,1339.0,the social system of science storer  this book is an exercise in sociological theory building it attempts to develop a theory of the social organization of science i have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance by pointing out certain basic parallels between the social system of science and other social systems within society i hope further that the approach used even if not the specific conclusions i have drawn from it may be useful in bridging the gap that seems now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who are concerned first of all with the motives attitudes and goals of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior my approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most individuals most of the time come to want to do what it is that society needs them to do only when we can answer this question satisfactorily can we develop a sociology capable of providing both prediction and meaning,
1339,1340.0,social theory and social structure merton  of the four chapters added to this edition two come from published symposia one of which is out of print and the other of which i am told is nearing that same state of exhaustion this chapter sets forth the concept of the influential identifies two distinctive types of influentials the local and the cosmopolitan and relates these types to the structure of influence in the local community the second of these chapters contributions to the theory of reference group behavior draws upon the ample evidence provided by the american soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves to the norms of various groups in particular the groups with which they are not affiliated the other two chapters added to this edition have not been published before the first of these continuities in the theory of social structure and anomie tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analyses of the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which is described as anomie the second continuities in the theory of reference groups and social structure tries to bring out some of the specially sociological as distinct from the socio psychological implications of current inquiries into reference group behavior the intent is to examine some of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solved before certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis of reference groups,
1340,1341.0,communication nets in science status and citation patterns in animal physiology whitley  by virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance and growth of science it is the means by which the individual scientist relates to the social system he publishes his work to gain recognition and reads the publications of others to maintain his knowledge the formal communication system also forms the basis for the allocation of rewards instrumental and consumatory thus it is a means of exercising social control the informal communication system although important is the distaff side its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory rewards legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by the social system through informal systems of communication though it is growing in importance as an information dissemination system,
1341,1342.0,problem areas and research networks in science mulkay  gilbert  woolgar  a general account is presented of the emergence growth and decline of scientific research networks and their associated problem areas research networks are seen to pass through three phases the first exploratory phase is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems the second phase is one of rapid growth associated with increasing social and intellectual integration made possible by improved communication an increasingly precise scientific consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation in which those participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence but as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically fruitful and as the network grows career opportunities diminish consequently the third final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the network together with the movement of participants to new areas of scientific opportunity,
1342,1343.0,the seven sexes a study in the sociology of a phenomenon or the replication of experiments in physics collins  the replication of scientific experiments is discussed stressing the problem of communication between the originator of an experiment and a scientist intending to replicate it models of communication are set up with reference to established fields a more marginal field is then investigated in the light of these models and it is concluded that scientists in the latter field should not be seen as engaged in replicating original experiment but in negotiating the rules of replication and hence the nature of the phenomenon under investigation,
1343,1344.0,some correlates of a citation measure of productivity in science bayer  folger  the science citation index provides an easy way to derive criterion measures of scientific accomplishment measures derived from citation counts the principal criterion have high face validity these criterion measures are found to have a low but positive correlation with the quality of scientists graduate education and no relation to his measured iq score plans for future research on the correlates of scientific productivity are briefly discussed,

1345,1346.0,patterns of intellectual influence in scientific research cole  a widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of scientists those historians and philosophers of science who express this point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral part of the developmental process the great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and to a large extent invisible scientists an alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that in the broader historical perspective most of the eminent scientists even of the calibre of nobel laureates and national academy members of today are the pedestrians of history this paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics three independent sets of data are analyzed one is drawn from a stratified random sample of american academic physicists a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics a third from a set of papers cited in the physical review all three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists the data support the hypothesis that the physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the research produced by a relatively small number of scientists the implications of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas for necessary future research are suggested,
1346,1347.0,inputs outputs and the prestige of university science departments hagstrom  this paper reports correlates of departmental prestige american council on education rating of the quality of graduate faculty 1966 for a sample of 125 departments in mathematics physics chemistry and biology the analysis mostly uses multivariate linear regression large and significant correlations with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size research production research opportunities faculty background including quality of phd university and faculty awards and offices combinations of from six to nine indicators of these variables account for about three fourths of the variance in departmental prestige when other types of variables are held constant indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly associated with departmental prestige correlations of prestige with rates of inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed differences in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied it is shown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific communication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding variables are held constant,

1386,1387.0,the structure of scientific revolutions kuhn  the essay that follows is the first full published report on a project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago at that time i was a graduate student in theoretical physics already within sight of the end of my dissertation a fortunate involvement with an experimental college course treating physical science for the non scientist provided my first exposure to out of date scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success those conceptions were ones i had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a long standing avocational interest in the philosophy of science somehow whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing the result was a drastic shift in my career plans a shift from physics to history of science and then gradually from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history except for a few articles this essay is the first of my published works in which these early concerns are dominant in some part it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how i happened to be drawn from science to its history in the first place,

1390,1391.0,a study of general categories applicable to classification and coding in documentation grolier  the rapid development of information retrieval methods since the last war together with the development of systems using mechanical or electromechanical means punched cards for such purposes followed later by electronic retrieval computers have led to transformations in the structure of classification or coding systems for books and documents generally speaking document specialists have tended to elaborate a large number of different codes usually totally unrelated to each other each conceived to meet the special documentation requirements of a particular organization this is farther than ever at least to all appearances from the original intention of 1895 of the founders of the institut international de bibliographie now known as the federation internationale de documentation i e the standardization of classification methods,
1391,1392.0,subject analysis computer implications of rigorous definator harris  subject analysis for information retrieval is an area which always seems deceptively simple to those without previous background in it however extensive their background in specific subject disciplines may be the basic requirement seems easy enough to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into and retrieved from an ordered file while attempts have been made to use simple non complex terms or even single words it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject and that some subjects are in themselves complex to express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts not words be separated and then recombined or that only one part of the subject be shown the former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble the latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants and ma require the indexer to decide under which part s of the concept an entry should be made,
1392,1393.0,the subject approach to information foskett  the first edition of this book published in 1969 was prompted by changes in the library association syllabus which for the first time enables lecturers to treat classification and subject cataloging as different aspects of the same topic these changes coincided with the publication of the results of the cranfield project which showed clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same however although it was possible to teach these new approaches there was no one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that i felt was needed the first edition was intended to fill this gap and its reception both in britain and abroad showed that it did indeed fulfill a real need it met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and more importantly from students particularly in the united states where british textbooks on classification had previously been regarded with something akin to suspicion as the dean of one american library school is alleged to have remarked what theory of classification,
1393,1394.0,subject catalogues heading and structure coates  in 1955 the publications committee of the library association approached my chief mr a j wells with a request that he should write a book on subject cataloguing at the time mr wells was preoccupied with the inauguration of the british national bibliography card service and he made the suggestion which was agreed by the committee that i should undertake the task the result is scarcely an adequate substitute for the book which mr wells would have written nevertheless he has had a major part in shaping my views on subject cataloguing and in this sense the present book stems back to him though he might not subscribe to all the views now put forward,
1394,1395.0,subject headings a practical guide haykin  the alphabetical subject catalog either self contained or as the subject element in the dictionary catalog is a later development that the systematic or classed catalog realkatalog catalogue raisonne in this country it has almost completely displaced the latter the principal classed catalogs now remaining are those of the engineering societies library in new york the john crerar library in chicago and the science and technology department of the carnegie library of pittsburgh there are nevertheless many things to commend the classed catalog rudolf kaiser sums up the argument between the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical catalog is concerned however his conclusion misses the mark since for one not completely the master of the system of classification there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library s collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross referenced,

1397,1398.0,switching and finite automata theory kohavi  the subject of switching and finite automata theory needs no introduction it has become a part of every computer science and electrical engineering curriculum and rightly so it provides techniques useful in a wide variety of applications and helps develop a way of thinking that leads to understanding of the structure behavior and limitations and capabilities of logical machines in this book i have tried to cover the whole subject starting with introductory material and leading to the more advanced topics assuming a minimal technical background on the part of the reader i did not attempt to provide detailed techniques for the design of specific circuits but rather to formulate methods and to develop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems for once such general principles are understood the relevance of specific procedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter of engineering decisions,
1398,1399.0,syntactic structures chomsky  this study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense as opposed to semantics and the narrow sense as opposed to phonemics and morphology it forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory the search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well established methods of linguistic analysis precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role both negative and positive in the process of discovery itself by pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and consequently gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data more positively a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed obscure and intuition bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects,

1400,1401.0,systems analysis of a university library final report on a research project buckland  the establishment of nine new universities in the 1960 s provoked a highly stimulating re examination of the nature purpose and management of academic libraries long established attitudes and methods were questioned but although changes were made the basic difficulty remained a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university the report of the ugc committee on librarys the parry report 267 which in general endorsed these changes also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision,
1401,1402.0,systems approach churchman  there is no question that in our age there is a good deal of turmoil about the manner in which our society is run probably at no prior point in the history of man has there been so much discussion about the rights and wrongs of the policy makers whether they be the politicians in albany or sacramento in washington paris or moscow the managers of far flung industrial firms or the people who run educational institutions in all cases the citizen feels a perfect right to have his say about the way in which the managers manage not only has the citizen become far more vocal but he has also in many instances begun to suspect that the people who make the major decisions that affect our lives don t know what they are doing they don t know what they are doing simply because they have no adequate basis to judge the effects of their decisions,
1402,1403.0,targets for research in library education borko  few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during the last decade and a half the criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own one can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for if the librarian researcher commits his findings to writing he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer or he finds that while many praise his work there are no funds possibilities or opportunities to translate his conclusions into action,
1403,1404.0,technical libraries users and their demands a classification of user groups and user demands in technical libraries slater  this study of the habits of customers of technical libraries and information departments had three main aims 1 determination of user demands to discover what items of information or documents customers seek why they seek them and how they obtain them 2 classification of user groups and their demands to test a hypothesis that it is possible to classify customers into meaningful user groups possessing recognizable common features and characteristic behavior patterns and to classify group needs 3 estimation of the significance of the above for librarians to measure the demand on librarians and libraries in terms of expenditure of their time and skill and use of stock made by different user groups,
1404,1405.0,techniques of information retrieval vickery  information retrieval is now an accepted part of the new discipline of information science and technology and its principles are taught not only in librarianship and documentation but also in courses of systems design there are half a dozen useful texts available each with a special emphasis arising from the varied backgrounds and interests of the authors,

1406,1407.0,technology information and organization information transfer in industrial r and d rosenbloom  this is an empirical study of information transfer in the r d operations of large industrial corporations its basis is a body of survey data collected from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations and from 1200 members of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers the data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues the analysis is descriptive in character following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work while the data in general confirm the results of other studies of this sort they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use the report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal organizational and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of information in a more general interpretation of these findings those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied the purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge the other to the support of particular operational objectives when the focus of work is on operational goals local and informal sources account for most instances of information transfer formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on professional goals i e those concerned with contributions to knowledge in conclusion the report discusses the effects which management may have within an organization on the process of information transfer and the need for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in this process of personal values task requisites and the structure of formal and social groups firms need to establish two way communication about needs and possibilities by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the needs of society,
1407,1408.0,technology and information transfer rosenbloom  in 1963 research at the harvard business school was initiated by richard rosenbloom and frank wolek to describe the process by which technical information is communicated and used national and corporate attention had been increasingly drawn to the interaction between scientific and technological advance and social change this problem was considered to be of considerable practical importance at that time as it still is this volume is a product of that effort the research focuses upon the flow of technical information across organizational lines in the research and development operations of large industrial corporations the basis of the work is a body of survey data collected from 2 000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of 4 corporations and from 1 200 members of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers the data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues the analysis is descriptive in character following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work,

1413,1414.0,the thesaurus in retrieval gilchrist  this book does not purport to provide all the answers to the problem such a claim would be rightly suspect but to collect together problems and experiences pertaining to the technique though three of the case studies in chapter 8 are from outside the united kingdom there is an inevitable bias towards british experience and english language thesauri it is hoped that people outside this country will find the book useful but there is little mention of for example the language problem the way in which compound terms are treated clearly depends on whether one is indexing in german french or english and each language exhibits a different morphology,
1414,1415.0,computer based selective dissemination of information sdi service for faculty using library of congress machine readable catalog marc records studer  from november 1966 through june 1968 the library of congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine readable form the marc records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating 209 70 percent responded affirmatively only 40 participants could be accommodated so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school anthropology l business 10 economics 3 education 15 government 4 history 4 and sociology 3 an interest statement from each faculty member was translated into both library of congress classification numbers e g e6ll and subject heading terms i e elements of discrete heading separated by a comma dash parenthesis or period e g u s hist civil war prisoners exchange of becomes six terms u s hist civil war prisoners exchange of the resulting interest profiles were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers the weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with marc records each profile was assigned a cutoff weight or hit level of 6 subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to exceed or be less than the hit level thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record all class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number three computer programs were employed in producing the sdi lists program extract used marc master tapes as input and extracted the card number accession number subject heading terms and class number for current records program retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for hits program print compared these card numbers with those on complete marc records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty one copy was for the faculty member s own use one was to be evaluated and returned and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the marc file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record whereas there is only one class number and a hit often occurred on a record s second or third heading the sdi system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records and overall evaluations were highly favorable some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty the majority felt that the sdi service provided an automatic regular notification of new works they felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields it required very little time and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done all faculty expressed a desire to have sdi service continued,
1415,1416.0,synthesis identification and control of distributed parameter systems jain  many synthesis identification and control problems that arise in distributed parameter systems are studied two major approaches viz the frequency domain approach and the time domain approach are considered the techniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated with optimization problems in distributed parameter systems in the frequency domain distributed systems described by the general linear telegrapher s equations are considered over a finite band of frequencies an electric network equivalent to these systems is developed many optimization problems that are of practical interest are formulated in terms of this new equivalent network some of the basic principles of lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are discussed in the time domain a method of characteristics is developed as a method of solution for optimization problems first and second order hyperbolic systems are considered imbedding and gradient techniques developed along the characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages it is shown that solving for green s function and associated eigenvalue problem is not required it is hoped that the methods developed here will lead efficiently to actual realization of optimal distributed systems,
1416,1417.0,least cost decision rules for the selection of library materials for compact storage lister  for the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future to help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little used materials two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are the fraction of the collection which is to be stored and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage this study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials two storage criteria one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates are discussed and compared for the age policy the objective is the determination of a least cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored the model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence the average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book the storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap hence although the least cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries an empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at purdue university and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature calculations for the least cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules that changes in the capacity related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential an important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules,
1417,1418.0,journal usage patterns and their implications in the planning of library systems o neill  access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research libraries particularly academic libraries have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world s literature most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve this use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has generally resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines the purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines the interdisciplinary relationships and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns these results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures based on citations usage and abstract data are developed each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms a discipline wheel is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines this framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines one of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of scattering of articles or title dispersion a powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the bradford distribution the bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results other possible distributions particularly the yule borel and the fisher distributions are also considered the applications of productivity functions in the operation design and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited their use in determining the size of a collection finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection determining user convenience and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered it is also possible based on productivity functions to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives the purdue university libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied a large set of citation data was collected this data consisted of 24 953 citations from 752 ph d dissertations written in technical fields at purdue university complete records of the university s scientific journal holdings were also obtained the bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results the similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries the breadth of the disciplines is also measured differences between the journal usage patterns and the system s holdings are examined alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions this study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion breadth of a discipline the similarity between disciplines and others the quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems,
1418,1419.0,utility of automatic classification systems for information storage and retrieval litofsky  large scale on line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous problems above those encountered by smaller systems the more critical of these problems involve degree of automation flexibility browsability storage space and retrieval time a step toward the solution of these problems is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and advantages the methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori automatic classification of the document collection feasibility is demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50 000 document descriptions the advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies by indexing the 50 000 documents by two independent methods one manual and one automatic it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the indexing method used it was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied one particular algorithm clasfy consistently outperformed the others in addition it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good with respect to the measured established in this dissertation as the a priori manual classification system currently in use with the aforementioned file the actual classification schedules produced by clasfy in classifying a file of almost 50 000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation,
1419,1420.0,time lag in cataloging pope  any who have the arduous task of assisting a student through that ultimate of academic exercises the preparation and defense of a dissertation are likely to define happiness as a good book written by an advisee this book is a cause of joy the author expended much more effort than is usually the case to gain even the smallest detail because the subject matter is strangely intractable hedged round with perplexities and not a few vested interests letters and reports get locked away where they may not be seen except by the most persistent investigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one else can claim in the end the author deserves the praise and the advisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comes from participation in an important investigation finished as an influential and well written book,

1421,1422.0,towards information retrieval fairthorne  the selection of papers published here explores activities in which indefinite neglect of either aspect the conceptual or the mechanical will lead to practical and theoretical disaster they centre on the recovery of records according to their subject matter since libraries began librarians have evolved studied and taught procedures for indexing and classifying these allow some delegation from subject specialists who understand the subject matter to library staff who can recognize the ways in which specialists talk about it the procedures consider mostly only the interpretation of texts not the text itself as an object with recognizable marks subject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering they assume the problems of topic identification solved and the methods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methods for describing the interpretations of texts,
1422,1423.0,training for library service a report prepared for the carnegie corporation of new york williamson  the primary purpose in preparing the following report was to present existing conditions in this country with respect to training for library work in such a way that the educator and the layman interested in educational problems might be able to form a true conception of the steps that should be taken to improve this phase of the library situation the author has been obliged to limit the scope of his study to the so called professional schools he has treated only incidentally training classes summer schools and other types of library training agency an effort has been made to discover and to point out the strong and weak points in the organization of these library schools and in the training which they offer many of the defects disclosed could be remedied by the schools themselves others are due to extreme poverty and can be remedied only by increased income,
1423,1424.0,university library administration rogers  a university library is both a collegiate library and a research library it is collegiate in its provision of books and other documentary records to support the students program of instruction and to encourage the habit of reading and the use of libraries as does the college library the university library must also provide materials for use by the faculty members in the preparation of their courses of instruction and by the staff of the institution in the performance of their administrative responsibilities however the university library differs from the college library in offering a wider range of undergraduate programs offering graduate instruction beyond the master s level and usually offering advanced professional programs in a number of fields,
1424,1425.0,undergraduate library hoadley  the development of the separately housed undergraduate library on the modern university campus is a recent innovation so recent in fact that in september 1965 there were only six such libraries in the united states the interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation of these libraries however is not of such recent origin as early as 1608 when thomas james was appointed to bodley s library he proposed the establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student but sir thomas bodley was opposed so it is to harvard that we turn for an example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate s plight despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers most universities and their libraries were relatively small until this century more important they were largely undergraduate institutions the great expansion of graduate education is a twentieth century phenomenon the problems of the undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of materials suitable for research the large university collections became increasingly difficult for the undergraduate to use when he had to select his books from the card catalog and obtain them through paging in a closed stack system he might well abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out missing or at the bindery and which was suitable for his purposes the university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded study conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the volume of work,

1426,1427.0,understanding media the extensions of man winograd  when it was decided that cognitive psychology would not specify size limits for articles and that we would publish relevant papers in artificial intelligence we hardly anticipated devoting an entire issue to a single piece of work however winograd s program for understanding natural language seems sufficiently general and important in its implications to warrant the experiment some readers will find sufficient the first two sections which present respectively an overview of the system and what it does and a first rate evaluation of research in artificial intelligence on natural language processing semantics and theorem proving others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntactic component the treatment of semantics and the programming language for specifying theories of problem solving each of these contributions is significant in its own right together they form a unique integrated system capable of parsing interpreting and acting upon the information contained in complex natural language discourse,

1431,1432.0,the ranking of biomedical periodicals from the indian scientist s point of view sengupta  the output of scientific literature has been increasing exponentially since the second quarter of this century new journals in specialized branches of science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for publication the limited resources or libraries particularly in the developing countries do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication consequently research libraries in such countries as india must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve they urgently need dependable data on the ranking of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective countries in this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field of the biomedical sciences from the point of view of the indian scientist this method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries by changing the citing journals according to their country s needs,

1437,1438.0,an unhurried view of copyright kaplan  copyright protection became necessary with the invention of the printing press and had its early beginnings in the british censorship laws the fortunes of the law of copyright have always been closely connected with freedom of expression on the one hand and with technological improvements in means of dissemination on the other successive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the control and exploitation of his intellectual property the related interest of the publisher and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas it is this striking of balances in the law of copyright in the past at present and for the future which constitutes the central theme of the james carpentier lectures delivered by professor benjamin kaplan at the columbia university school of law in march 1966,

1439,1440.0,book availability and the library user guyton  the essentially logistical problem of making library books physically available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship this book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem as such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions no apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship the fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and thereby to improved library services,
1440,1441.0,universal bibliographic control anderson  ifla will be nearly fifty years old when dorothy anderson s ubc paper is published it is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue when librarians first began to look beyond their national borders bibliographic control was in the forefront of their concern gradually however these pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations on the social and even economic achievements of the international library community which was not fully international at all were limited to comparisons of national efforts with some countries constantly over critical and others overgenerous outstanding bibliographic projects like the gesamtkatalog der wiegendrucke were international in scope but national in conception,

1442,1443.0,universals in linguistic theory fillmore  we feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking in the last decade it is not longer of any interest to describe one after another language anyhow without regard to the relevance of the facts to general linguistic theory as ross put it it makes no sense to talk about describing a language in terms of its own structure alone toward the end of the conference when it had become apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently explicitly formulated model the question was raised what should we be teaching our students langendoen s answer seems to us most apt we should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic problem when they see one that is one which throws some light negative or positive on our conceptions of what languages in general are like,

1455,1456.0,world dynamics forrester  over the last several decades interest in economic development population growth and the world environment has expanded rapidly as world wide stresses have increased many individuals and organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing aspects of the world situation but it seems fair to observe that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets of the world system little has yet been done to show how the many actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total consequences that we observe now however many persons are coming to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important than the sum of the separate parts this book was undertaken as one step toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from mutual interplay between its demographic industrial and agricultural subsystems,
1456,1457.0,world trends in library education bramley  one of the most significant aspects of the evolution of librarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession the intention of the present work is to examine some of the implications of this rapid growth in the number of library schools noting current trends and possible changes in the future inevitably some limitations have had to be imposed and there has been a deliberate concentration upon anglo american library education while at the same time examining other major patterns of professional education for librarians which exist in the world and comparing these with the approach of the english speaking countries an attempt has been made to trace the influences which the british and america systems of library education have had particularly in the developing countries,
1457,1458.0,legal restrictions on exploitation of the patent monopoly an economic analysis baxter  the patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others from making using or selling his invention in furtherance of a constitutionally recognized goal to promote the progress of science and the useful arts congress has thus adopted a constitutionally authorized means securing to inventors the exclusive right to their respective discoveries the constitutional clause is remarkable in several respects its recognition of the possibility that invention might require encouragement implies not only that technological innovation is desirable but also that but for legal subsidization the quantity of innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum this recognition coming on the morn of an era during which the tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities was greatly and religiously overestimated prompts brief inquiry into the soundness of the supposition,
